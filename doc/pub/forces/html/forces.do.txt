===== Single-particle and two-particle quantum numbers =====
!bblock
In order to understand the basics of the nucleon-nucleon interaction, we need to define the relevant quantum numbers and how we build up a single-particle state and a two-body state. 

* For the single-particle states, due to the fact that we have the spin-orbit force, the quantum numbers for the projection of orbital momentum $l$, that is $m_l$, and for spin $s$, that is $m_s$, are no longer so-called good quantum numbers. The total angular momentum $j$ and its projection $m_j$ are then  so-called *good quantum numbers*.
* This means that the operator $\hat{J}^2$ does not commute with $\hat{L}_z$  or $\hat{S}_z$.  
* We also start normally with single-particle state functions defined using say the harmonic oscillator. For these functions, we have no explicit dependence on $j$. How can we introduce single-particle wave functions which have $j$ and its projection $m_j$ as quantum numbers?

===== Single-particle and two-particle quantum numbers, brief review on angular momenta etc =====

!bblock
We have that the operators for the orbital momentum are given by
!bt
\[
L_x=-i\hbar(y\frac{\partial }{\partial z}-z\frac{\partial }{\partial y})=
yp_z-zp_y,
\]
!et
!bt
\[
L_y=-i\hbar(z\frac{\partial }{\partial x}-x\frac{\partial }{\partial z})= zp_x-xp_z,
\]
!et
!bt
\[
L_z=-i\hbar(x\frac{\partial }{\partial y}-y\frac{\partial }{\partial x})=xp_y-yp_x.
\]
!et

!bblock
Since we have a spin orbit force which is strong, it is easy to show that 
the total angular momentum operator
!bt
\[
   \hat{J}=\hat{L}+\hat{S}
\]
!et
does not commute with $\hat{L}_z$ and $\hat{S}_z$. To see this, we calculate for example
!bt
\begin{eqnarray} 
   [\hat{L}_z,\hat{J}^2]&=&[\hat{L}_z,(\hat{L}+\hat{S})^2] \\ \nonumber
   &=&[\hat{L}_z,\hat{L}^2+\hat{S}^2+2\hat{L}\hat{S}]\\ \nonumber 
   &=& [\hat{L}_z,\hat{L}\hat{S}]=[\hat{L}_z,\hat{L}_x\hat{S}_x+\hat{L}_y\hat{S}_y+\hat{L}_z\hat{S}_z]\ne 0, 
\end{eqnarray}
!et
since we have that $[\hat{L}_z,\hat{L}_x]=i\hbar\hat{L}_y$ and $[\hat{L}_z,\hat{L}_y]=i\hbar\hat{L}_x$.

===== Single-particle and two-particle quantum numbers, brief review on angular momenta etc =====
!bblock
We have also
!bt
\[
   |\hat{J}|=\hbar\sqrt{J(J+1)},
\]
!et
with the the following degeneracy
!bt
\[
   M_J=-J, -J+1, \dots, J-1, J.
\]
!et
With a given value of  $L$ and $S$ we can then determine the possible values of 
 $J$ by studying the $z$ component of  $\hat{J}$. 
It is given by
!bt
\[
\hat{J}_z=\hat{L}_z+\hat{S}_z.
\]
!et
The operators $\hat{L}_z$ and $\hat{S}_z$ have the quantum numbers
$L_z=M_L\hbar$ and $S_z=M_S\hbar$, respectively, meaning that
!bt
\[
   M_J\hbar=M_L\hbar +M_S\hbar,
\]
!et
or
!bt
\[
   M_J=M_L +M_S.
\]
!et
Since the max value of  $M_L$ is $L$ and for  $M_S$ is $S$
we obtain
!bt
\[
   (M_J)_{\mathrm{maks}}=L+S.
\]
!et
!eblock

!split
===== Single-particle and two-particle quantum numbers, brief review on angular momenta etc =====
!bblock
For nucleons we have that the maximum value of $M_S=m_s=1/2$, yielding
!bt
\[
   (m_j)_{\mathrm{max}}=l+\frac{1}{2}.
\]
!et
Using this and the fact that the maximum value of  $M_J=m_j$ is $j$ we have
!bt
\[
   j=l+\frac{1}{2}, l-\frac{1}{2}, l-\frac{3}{2}, l-\frac{5}{2}, \dots 
\]
!et
To decide where this series terminates, we use the vector inequality
!bt
\[
   |\hat{L}+\hat{S}| \ge \left| |\hat{L}|-|\hat{S}|\right|.
\]
!et
!eblock


!split
===== Single-particle and two-particle quantum numbers, brief review on angular momenta etc =====
!bblock
Using $\hat{J}=\hat{L}+\hat{S}$ we get 
!bt
\[
   |\hat{J}| \ge |\hat{L}|-|\hat{S}|,
\]
!et
or
!bt
\[
   |\hat{J}|=\hbar\sqrt{J(J+1)}\ge |\hbar\sqrt{L(L+1)}-
   \hbar\sqrt{S(S+1)}|.
\]
!et
!eblock



!split
===== Single-particle and two-particle quantum numbers, brief review on angular momenta etc =====
!bblock
If we limit ourselves to nucleons only with $s=1/2$ we find that
!bt
\[
   |\hat{J}|=\hbar\sqrt{j(j+1)}\ge |\hbar\sqrt{l(l+1)}-
   \hbar\sqrt{\frac{1}{2}(\frac{1}{2}+1)}|.
\]
!et
It is then easy to show that for nucleons there are only two possible values of
$j$ which satisfy the inequality, namely
!bt
\[
   j=l+\frac{1}{2}\hspace{0.1cm} \mathrm{or} \hspace{0.1cm}j=l-\frac{1}{2},
\]
!et
and with $l=0$ we get 
!bt
\[
   j=\frac{1}{2}.
\]
!et

Let us study some selected examples. We need also to keep in mind that parity is conserved.
The strong and electromagnetic Hamiltonians conserve parity. Thus the eigenstates can be
broken down into two classes of states labeled by their parity $\pi= +1$ or $\pi=-1$.
The nuclear interactions do not mix states with different parity.

For nuclear structure the total parity originates
from the intrinsic parity of the nucleon which is $\pi_{\mathrm{intrinsic}}=+1$ 
and the parities associated with
the orbital angular momenta $\pi_l=(-1)^l$ . The total parity is the product over all nucleons
$\pi = \prod_i \pi_{\mathrm{intrinsic}}(i)\pi_l(i) = \prod_i (-1)^{l_i}$

The basis states we deal with are constructed so that they conserve parity and have thus a definite parity. 

Note that we do have parity violating processes, more on this later although our focus will be mainly on non-parity viloating processes

===== Single-particle and two-particle quantum numbers =====

Consider now the single-particle orbits of the $1s0d$ shell. 
For a $0d$ state we have the quantum numbers $l=2$, $m_l=-2,-1,0,1,2$, $s+1/2$, $m_s=\pm 1/2$,
$n=0$ (the number of nodes of the wave function).   This means that we have positive parity and
!bt
\[
j=\frac{3}{2}=l-s\hspace{1cm} m_j=-\frac{3}{2},-\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{2},\frac{3}{2}.
\]
!et
and
!bt
\[
j=\frac{5}{2}=l+s\hspace{1cm} m_j=-\frac{5}{2},-\frac{3}{2},-\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{2},\frac{3}{2},\frac{5}{2}.
\]
!et
!eblock


!split
===== Single-particle and two-particle quantum numbers =====
!bblock
Our single-particle wave functions, if we use the harmonic oscillator, do however not contain the quantum numbers $j$ and $m_j$.
Normally what we have is an eigenfunction for the one-body problem defined as
!bt
\[
\phi_{nlm_lsm_s}(r,\theta,\phi)=R_{nl}(r)Y_{lm_l}(\theta,\phi)\xi_{sm_s},
\]
!et
where we have used spherical coordinates (with a spherically symmetric potential) and the spherical harmonics
!bt 
\[
    Y_{lm_l}(\theta,\phi)=P(\theta)F(\phi)=\sqrt{\frac{(2l+1)(l-m_l)!}{4\pi (l+m_l)!}}
                      P_l^{m_l}(cos(\theta))\exp{(im_l\phi)},
\]
!et
with $P_l^{m_l}$ being the so-called associated Legendre polynomials. 
!eblock



!split
===== Single-particle and two-particle quantum numbers =====
!bblock
Examples are
!bt
\[
   Y_{00}=\sqrt{\frac{1}{4\pi}},
\]
!et
for $l=m_l=0$, 
!bt
\[
   Y_{10}=\sqrt{\frac{3}{4\pi}}cos(\theta),
\]
!et
for $l=1$ and $m_l=0$, 
!bt
\[
   Y_{1\pm 1}=\sqrt{\frac{3}{8\pi}}sin(\theta)exp(\pm i\phi),
\]
!et
for  $l=1$ and $m_l=\pm 1$, 
!bt
\[
   Y_{20}=\sqrt{\frac{5}{16\pi}}(3cos^2(\theta)-1)
\]
!et
for $l=2$ and $m_l=0$ etc. 
!eblock

===== Single-particle and two-particle quantum numbers =====
!bblock
How can we get a function in terms of $j$ and $m_j$?
Define now
!bt
\[
\phi_{nlm_lsm_s}(r,\theta,\phi)=R_{nl}(r)Y_{lm_l}(\theta,\phi)\xi_{sm_s},
\]
!et
and
!bt 
\[
\psi_{njm_j;lm_lsm_s}(r,\theta,\phi),
\]
!et
as the state with quantum numbers $jm_j$.
Operating with 
!bt
\[
   \hat{j}^2=(\hat{l}+\hat{s})^2=\hat{l}^2+\hat{s}^2+2\hat{l}_z\hat{s}_z+\hat{l}_+\hat{s}_{-}+\hat{l}_{-}\hat{s}_{+},
\]
!et
on the latter state we will obtain admixtures from possible $\phi_{nlm_lsm_s}(r,\theta,\phi)$ states.
!eblock


!split
===== Single-particle and two-particle quantum numbers =====
!bblock
To see this, we consider the following example and fix
!bt
\[
j=\frac{3}{2}=l-s\hspace{1cm} m_j=\frac{3}{2}.
\]
!et
and
!bt
\[
j=\frac{5}{2}=l+s\hspace{1cm} m_j=\frac{3}{2}.
\]
!et
It means we can have, with $l=2$ and $s=1/2$ being fixed, in order to have $m_j=3/2$ either $m_l=1$ and $m_s=1/2$ or
$m_l=2$ and $m_s=-1/2$. The two states    
!bt
\[
\psi_{n=0j=5/2m_j=3/2;l=2s=1/2}
\]
!et
and
!bt
\[
\psi_{n=0j=3/2m_j=3/2;l=2s=1/2}
\]
!et
will have admixtures from $\phi_{n=0l=2m_l=2s=1/2m_s=-1/2}$ and $\phi_{n=0l=2m_l=1s=1/2m_s=1/2}$. 
How do we find these admixtures? Note that we don't specify the values of $m_l$ and $m_s$ 
in the functions $\psi$ since    
$\hat{j}^2$ does not commute with $\hat{L}_z$ and $\hat{S}_z$. 
!eblock

!split
===== Single-particle and two-particle quantum numbers =====
!bblock
We operate with 
!bt
\[
   \hat{j}^2=(\hat{l}+\hat{s})^2=\hat{l}^2+\hat{s}^2+2\hat{l}_z\hat{s}_z+\hat{l}_+\hat{s}_{-}+\hat{l}_{-}\hat{s}_{+}
\]
!et
on the two $jm_j$ states, that is
!bt
\[
\hat{j}^2\psi_{n=0j=5/2m_j=3/2;l=2s=1/2}= \alpha\hbar^2[l(l+1)+\frac{3}{4}+2m_lm_s]\phi_{n=0l=2m_l=2s=1/2m_s=-1/2}+
\]
!et
!bt
\[
\beta\hbar^2\sqrt{l(l+1)-m_l(m_l-1)}\phi_{n=0l=2m_l=1s=1/2m_s=1/2},
\]
!et
and
!bt 
\[
\hat{j}^2\psi_{n=0j=3/2m_j=3/2;l=2s=1/2}= \alpha\hbar^2[l(l+1)+\frac{3}{4}+2m_lm_s]+ \phi_{n=0l=2m_l=1s=1/2m_s=1/2}+
\]
!et
!bt
\[
\beta\hbar^2\sqrt{l(l+1)-m_l(m_l+1)}\phi_{n=0l=2m_l=2s=1/2m_s=-1/2}.
\]
!et
!eblock

!split
===== Single-particle and two-particle quantum numbers =====
!bblock
This means that the eigenvectors $\phi_{n=0l=2m_l=2s=1/2m_s=-1/2}$ etc are not eigenvectors of $\hat{j}^2$. The above problems gives a $2\times2$ matrix that mixes the vectors $\psi_{n=0j=5/2m_j3/2;l=2m_ls=1/2m_s}$ and $\psi_{n=0j=3/2m_j3/2;l=2m_ls=1/2m_s}$ with the states  $\phi_{n=0l=2m_l=2s=1/2m_s=-1/2}$ and
$\phi_{n=0l=2m_l=1s=1/2m_s=1/2}$. The unknown coefficients $\alpha$ and $\beta$ results from eigenvectors of this matrix. That is, inserting all values $m_l,l,m_s,s$ we obtain the matrix 
!bt
\[
\left[ \begin{array} {cc} 19/4 & 2 \\ 2 & 31/4 \end{array} \right]\]
!et
whose eigenvectors are the columns of
!bt
\[
\left[ \begin{array} {cc} 2/\sqrt{5} &1/\sqrt{5}  \\ 1/\sqrt{5} & -2/\sqrt{5} \end{array}\right]\]  
!et
These numbers define the so-called Clebsch-Gordan coupling coefficients  (the overlaps between the two basis sets). We can thus write
!bt
\[
\psi_{njm_j;ls}=\sum_{m_lm_s}\langle lm_lsm_s|jm_j\rangle\phi_{nlm_lsm_s},
\]
!et
where the coefficients $\langle lm_lsm_s|jm_j\rangle$ are the so-called Clebsch-Gordan coeffficients.
!eblock

!split
===== Clebsch-Gordan coefficients =====
!bblock
The Clebsch-Gordan coeffficients $\langle lm_lsm_s|jm_j\rangle$ have some interesting properties for us, like the following  orthogonality relations
!bt
\[
\sum_{m_1m_2}\langle j_1m_1j_2m_2|JM\rangle\langle j_1m_1j_2m_2|J'M'\rangle=\delta_{J,J'}\delta_{M,M'},
\]
!et
!bt
\[
\sum_{JM}\langle j_1m_1j_2m_2|JM\rangle\langle j_1m_1'j_2m_2'|JM\rangle=\delta_{m_1,m_1'}\delta_{m_2,m_2'},
\]
!et
!bt
\[
\langle j_1m_1j_2m_2|JM\rangle=(-1)^{j_1+j_2-J}\langle j_2m_2j_1m_1|JM\rangle,
\]
!et
and many others. The latter will turn extremely useful when we are going to define two-body states and interactions in a coupled basis.
!eblock

!split
===== Quantum numbers and the Schroeodinger equation in relative and CM coordinates =====
!bblock
Summing up, for 
for the single-particle case, we have the following eigenfunctions 
!bt
\[
\psi_{njm_j;ls}=\sum_{m_lm_s}\langle lm_lsm_s|jm_j\rangle\phi_{nlm_lsm_s},
\]
!et
where the coefficients $\langle lm_lsm_s|jm_j\rangle$ are the so-called Clebsch-Gordan coeffficients.
The relevant quantum numbers are $n$ (related to the principal quantum number and the number of nodes of the wave function) and 
!bt
\[
   \hat{j}^2\psi_{njm_j;ls}=\hbar^2j(j+1)\psi_{njm_j;ls},
\]
!et
!bt
\[
   \hat{j}_z\psi_{njm_j;ls}=\hbar m_j\psi_{njm_j;ls},
\]
!et
!bt
\[
   \hat{l}^2\psi_{njm_j;ls}=\hbar^2l(l+1)\psi_{njm_j;ls},
\]
!et
!bt
\[
   \hat{s}^2\psi_{njm_j;ls}=\hbar^2s(s+1)\psi_{njm_j;ls},
\]
!et
but $s_z$ and $l_z$ do not result in good quantum numbers in a basis where we
use the angular momentum $j$.
!eblock

!split
===== Quantum numbers and the Schroedinger equation in relative and CM coordinates =====
!bblock
For a two-body state where we couple two angular momenta $j_1$ and $j_2$ to a final
angular momentum $J$ with projection $M_J$, we can define a similar transformation in terms
of the Clebsch-Gordan coeffficients
!bt
\[
\psi_{(j_1j_2)JM_J}=\sum_{m_{j_1}m_{j_2}}\langle j_1m_{j_1}j_2m_{j_2}|JM_J\rangle\psi_{n_1j_1m_{j_1};l_1s_1}\psi_{n_2j_2m_{j_2};l_2s_2}.
\]
!et
We will write these functions in a more compact form hereafter, namely,
!bt
\[
|(j_1j_2)JM_J\rangle=\psi_{(j_1j_2)JM_J},
\]
!et
and
!bt 
\[
|j_im_{j_i}\rangle=\psi_{n_ij_im_{j_i};l_is_i},
\]
!et
where we have skipped the explicit reference to $l$, $s$ and $n$. The spin of a nucleon is always $1/2$ while the value of $l$ can be deduced from the parity of the state.
It is thus normal to label a state with a given total angular momentum as 
$j^{\pi}$, where $\pi=\pm 1$. 
!eblock

!split
===== Quantum numbers and the Schroedinger equation in relative and CM coordinates =====
!bblock
Our two-body state can thus be written as 
!bt
\[
|(j_1j_2)JM_J\rangle=\sum_{m_{j_1}m_{j_2}}\langle j_1m_{j_1}j_2m_{j_2}|JM_J\rangle|j_1m_{j_1}\rangle|j_2m_{j_2}\rangle.
\]
!et
Due to the coupling order of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient it reads as 
$j_1$ coupled to $j_2$ to yield a final angular momentum $J$. If we invert the order of coupling we would have
!bt
\[
|(j_2j_1)JM_J\rangle=\sum_{m_{j_1}m_{j_2}}\langle j_2m_{j_2}j_1m_{j_1}|JM_J\rangle|j_1m_{j_1}\rangle|j_2m_{j_2}\rangle,
\]
!et
and due to the symmetry properties of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient we have
!bt
\[
|(j_2j_1)JM_J\rangle=(-1)^{j_1+j_2-J}\sum_{m_{j_1}m_{j_2}}\langle j_1m_{j_1}j_2m_{j_2}|JM_J\rangle|j_1m_{j_1}\rangle|j_2m_{j_2}\rangle=(-1)^{j_1+j_2-J}|(j_1j_2)JM_J\rangle.
\]
!et
We call the basis $|(j_1j_2)JM_J\rangle$ for the _coupled basis_, or just $j$-coupled basis/scheme. The basis formed by the simple product of single-particle eigenstates 
$|j_1m_{j_1}\rangle|j_2m_{j_2}\rangle$ is called the _uncoupled-basis_, or just the $m$-scheme basis. 
!eblock

!split
===== Quantum numbers =====
!bblock
We have thus the coupled basis 
!bt
\[
|(j_1j_2)JM_J\rangle=\sum_{m_{j_1}m_{j_2}}\langle j_1m_{j_1}j_2m_{j_2}|JM_J\rangle|j_1m_{j_1}\rangle|j_2m_{j_2}\rangle.
\]
!et
and the uncoupled basis 
!bt
\[
|j_1m_{j_1}\rangle|j_2m_{j_2}\rangle.
\]
!et
The latter can easily be generalized to many single-particle states whereas the first 
needs specific coupling coefficients and definitions of coupling orders. 
The $m$-scheme basis is easy to implement numerically and is used in most standard shell-model codes. 
Our coupled basis obeys also the following relations
!bt
\[
   \hat{J}^2|(j_1j_2)JM_J\rangle=\hbar^2J(J+1)|(j_1j_2)JM_J\rangle
\]
!et
!bt
\[
   \hat{J}_z|(j_1j_2)JM_J\rangle=\hbar M_J|(j_1j_2)JM_J\rangle,
\]
!et

===== Components of the force and isospin =====
!bblock
 The nuclear forces are almost charge independent. If we assume they are, 
we can introduce a new quantum number which is conserved. For nucleons only, that is a proton and neutron, we can limit ourselves
to two possible values which allow us to distinguish between the two particles. If we assign an isospin value of $\tau=1/2$ for protons
and neutrons (they belong to an isospin doublet, in the same way as we discussed the spin $1/2$ multiplet), we can define 
the neutron to have isospin projection $\tau_z=+1/2$ and a proton to have $\tau_z=-1/2$. These assignements are the standard choices in low-energy nuclear physics.
!eblock

!split
===== Isospin =====
!bblock
This leads to the introduction of an additional quantum number called isospin.
We can define a single-nucleon
state function in terms of the quantum numbers $n$, $j$, $m_j$, $l$, $s$, $\tau$ and $\tau_z$. Using our definitions in terms of an uncoupled basis, we had 
!bt
\[
\psi_{njm_j;ls}=\sum_{m_lm_s}\langle lm_lsm_s|jm_j\rangle\phi_{nlm_lsm_s},
\]
!et
which we can now extend to
!bt
\[
\psi_{njm_j;ls}\xi_{\tau\tau_z}=\sum_{m_lm_s}\langle lm_lsm_s|jm_j\rangle\phi_{nlm_lsm_s}\xi_{\tau\tau_z},
\]
!et
with the isospin spinors defined as 
!bt
\[
\xi_{\tau=1/2\tau_z=+1/2}=\left(\begin{array}{c} 1  \\ 0\end{array}\right),
\]
!et
and
!bt
\[
\xi_{\tau=1/2\tau_z=-1/2}=\left(\begin{array}{c} 0  \\ 1\end{array}\right).
\]
!et
We can then define the proton state function as 
!bt
\[
\psi^p(\mathbf{r})  =\psi_{njm_j;ls}(\mathbf{r})\left(\begin{array}{c} 0  \\ 1\end{array}\right), 
\]
!et
and similarly for neutrons as
!bt
\[
\psi^n(\mathbf{r})  =\psi_{njm_j;ls}(\mathbf{r})\left(\begin{array}{c} 1  \\ 0\end{array}\right). 
\]
!et
!eblock


!split
===== Isospin =====
!bblock
We can in turn define the isospin Pauli matrices (in the same as we define the spin matrices) as
!bt
\[
\hat{\tau}_x =\left(\begin{array}{cc} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{array}\right),
\]
!et
!bt
\[
\hat{\tau}_y =\left(\begin{array}{cc} 0 & -\imath \\ \imath & 0 \end{array}\right),
\]
!et
and
!bt
\[
\hat{\tau}_z =\left(\begin{array}{cc} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{array}\right),
\]
!et
and operating with $\hat{\tau}_z$ on the proton state function we have
!bt
\[
\hat{\tau}_z\psi^p(\mathbf{r})=-\frac{1}{2}\psi^p(\mathbf{r}),
\]
!et
and for neutrons we have
!bt
\[
\hat{\tau}\psi^n(\mathbf{r})=\frac{1}{2}\psi^n(\mathbf{r}).
\]
!et
!eblock

!split
===== Isospin =====
!bblock
We can now define the so-called charge operator as 
!bt
\[
\frac{\hat{Q}}{e} = \frac{1}{2}\left(1-\hat{\tau}_z\right)=\begin{Bmatrix} 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{Bmatrix},
\]
!et
which results in 
!bt
\[
\frac{\hat{Q}}{e}\psi^p(\mathbf{r})=\psi^p(\mathbf{r}),
\]
!et
and
!bt 
\[
\frac{\hat{Q}}{e}\psi^n(\mathbf{r})=0,
\]
!et
as it should be. 
!eblock

!split
===== Isospin =====
!bblock
The total isospin is defined as
!bt
\[
\hat{T}=\sum_{i=1}^A\hat{\tau}_i,
\]
!et
and its corresponding isospin projection as
!bt
\[
\hat{T}_z=\sum_{i=1}^A\hat{\tau}_{z_i},
\]

If charge is conserved, the Hamiltonian $\hat{H}$ commutes with $\hat{T}_z$ and all members of a given isospin multiplet
(that is the same value of $T$) have the same energy and there is no $T_z$ dependence and we say that $\hat{H}$ is a scalar in isospin space.

===== Two-body matrix elements =====
!bblock
Till now we have not said anything about the explicit calculation of two-body matrix elements. It is time to amend this deficiency.
We have till now seen the following definitions of a two-body matrix elements. In $m$-scheme
with quantum numbers $p=j_pm_p$ etc we have a two-body state defined as
!bt
\[
|(pq)M\rangle  = a^{\dagger}_pa^{\dagger}_q|\Phi_0\rangle,
\]
!et
where $|\Phi_0\rangle$ is a chosen reference state, say for example the Slater determinant which approximates ${}^{16}\mbox{O}$ with the $0s$ and the $0p$ shells being filled, and $M=m_p+m_q$. Recall that we label single-particle states above the Fermi level as $abcd\dots$ and states below the Fermi level for $ijkl\dots$.  
In case of two-particles in the single-particle states $a$ and $b$ outside ${}^{16}\mbox{O}$ as a closed shell core, say ${}^{18}\mbox{O}$, 
we would write the representation of the Slater determinant as
!bt
\[
|^{18}\mathrm{O}\rangle =|(ab)M\rangle  = a^{\dagger}_aa^{\dagger}_b|^{16}\mathrm{O}\rangle=|\Phi^{ab}\rangle.
\]
!et
In case of two-particles removed from say ${}^{16}\mbox{O}$, for example two neutrons in the single-particle states $i$ and $j$, we would write this as
!bt
\[
|^{14}\mathrm{O}\rangle =|(ij)M\rangle  = a_ja_i|^{16}\mathrm{O}\rangle=|\Phi_{ij}\rangle.
\]

|^{16}\mathrm{O}\rangle_{1p1h} =|(ai)M\rangle  = a_a^{\dagger}a_i|^{16}\mathrm{O}\rangle=|\Phi_{i}^a\rangle,
\]
!et
and finally for a two-particle-two-hole state we 
!bt
\[
|^{16}\mathrm{O}\rangle_{2p2h} =|(abij)M\rangle  = a_a^{\dagger}a_b^{\dagger}a_ja_i|^{16}\mathrm{O}\rangle=|\Phi_{ij}^{ab}\rangle.

Let us go back to the case of two-particles in the single-particle states $a$ and $b$ outside ${}^{16}\mbox{O}$ as a closed shell core, say ${}^{18}\mbox{O}$.
The representation of the Slater determinant is 
!bt
\[
|^{18}\mathrm{O}\rangle =|(ab)M\rangle  = a^{\dagger}_aa^{\dagger}_b|^{16}\mathrm{O}\rangle=|\Phi^{ab}\rangle.
\]
!et
The anti-symmetrized matrix element is detailed as 
!bt
\[
\langle (ab) M | \hat{V} | (cd) M \rangle = \langle (j_am_aj_bm_b)M=m_a+m_b |  \hat{V} | (j_cm_cj_dm_d)M=m_a+m_b \rangle,
\]
!et
and note that anti-symmetrization means 
!bt
\[
\langle (ab) M | \hat{V} | (cd) M \rangle =-\langle (ba) M | \hat{V} | (cd) M \rangle =\langle (ba) M | \hat{V} | (dc) M \rangle,
\]
!et
!bt
\[
\langle (ab) M | \hat{V} | (cd) M \rangle =-\langle (ab) M | \hat{V} | (dc) M \rangle. 
\]
!et
This matrix element is the expectation value of 
!bt
\[
\langle ^{16}\mathrm{O}|a_ba_a\frac{1}{4}\sum_{pqrs}\langle (pq) M | \hat{V} | (rs) M' \rangle a^{\dagger}_pa^{\dagger}_qa_sa_r a^{\dagger}_ca^{\dagger}_c|^{16}\mathrm{O}\rangle.

===== Two-body matrix elements in $J$-scheme =====
!bblock 
We have also defined matrix elements in the coupled basis, the so-called $J$-coupled scheme.
In this case the two-body wave function for two neutrons outside ${}^{16}\mbox{O}$ is written as 
!bt
\[
|^{18}\mathrm{O}\rangle_J =|(ab)JM\rangle  = \left\{a^{\dagger}_aa^{\dagger}_b\right\}^J_M|^{16}\mathrm{O}\rangle=N_{ab}\sum_{m_am_b}\langle j_am_aj_bm_b|JM\rangle|\Phi^{ab}\rangle, 
\]
!et
with
!bt 
\[
|\Phi^{ab}\rangle=a^{\dagger}_aa^{\dagger}_b|^{16}\mathrm{O}\rangle.
\]
!et
We have now an explicit coupling order, where the angular momentum $j_a$ is coupled to the angular momentum $j_b$ to yield a final two-body angular momentum $J$. 
The normalization factor (to be derived below) is
!bt
\[
N_{ab}=\frac{\sqrt{1+\delta_{ab}\times (-1)^J}}{1+\delta_{ab}}.
\]
!et  
!eblock

!split
===== Two-body matrix elements in $J$-scheme =====
!bblock
The implementation of the Pauli principle looks different in the $J$-scheme compared with the $m$-scheme. In the latter, no two fermions or more can have the same set of quantum numbers. In the $J$-scheme, when we write a state with the shorthand 
!bt
\[
|^{18}\mathrm{O}\rangle_J =|(ab)JM\rangle,
\]
!et
we do refer to the angular momenta only. This means that another way of writing the last state is
!bt
\[
|^{18}\mathrm{O}\rangle_J =|(j_aj_b)JM\rangle.
\]
!et
We will use this notation throughout when we refer to a two-body state in $J$-scheme. The Kronecker $\delta$ function in the normalization factor 
refers thus to the values of $j_a$ and $j_b$. If two identical particles are in a state with the same $j$-value, then only even values of the total angular momentum apply.

Note also that, using the anti-commuting properties of the creation operators, we obtain
!bt
\[

\]
!et
Furthermore, using the property of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient
!bt
\[
\langle j_am_aj_bm_b|JM>=(-1)^{j_a+j_b-J}\langle j_bm_bj_am_a|JM\rangle,
\]
!et
which can be used to show that
!bt
\[
|(j_bj_a)JM\rangle  = \left\{a^{\dagger}_ba^{\dagger}_a\right\}^J_M|^{16}\mathrm{O}\rangle=N_{ab}\sum_{m_am_b}\langle j_bm_bj_am_a|JM\rangle|\Phi^{ba}\rangle, 
\]
!et
is equal to 
!bt
\[
|(j_bj_a)JM\rangle=(-1)^{j_a+j_b-J+1}|(j_aj_b)JM\rangle.
\]
!et
This relation is important since we will need it when using anti-symmetrized matrix elements in $J$-scheme.

===== Two-body matrix elements in $J$-scheme =====

The two-body matrix element is a scalar and since it obeys rotational symmetry, it is diagonal in $J$, 
meaning that the corresponding matrix element in $J$-scheme is 
!bt
\[
\langle (j_aj_b) JM | \hat{V} | (j_cj_d) JM \rangle = N_{ab}N_{cd}\sum_{m_am_b m_cm_d}\langle j_am_aj_bm_b|JM\rangle

Since
!bt
\[
|(j_bj_a)JM\rangle=(-1)^{j_a+j_b-J+1}|(j_aj_b)JM\rangle,
\]
!et
the anti-symmetrized matrix elements need now to obey the following relations
!bt
\[
\langle (j_aj_b) JM | \hat{V} | (j_cj_d) JM \rangle = (-1)^{j_a+j_b-J+1}\langle (j_bj_a) JM | \hat{V} | (j_cj_d) JM \rangle,

!bblock Features of the Nucleon-Nucleon (NN) Force

The aim is to give you an overview over central features of the nucleon-nucleon interaction and how it is constructed, with both technical and theoretical approaches. 

* The existence of the deuteron with $J^{\pi}=1^+$ indicates that the force between protons and neutrons is attractive at least for the $^3S_1$ partial wave. Interference between Coulomb and nuclear scattering for the proton-proton partial wave $^1S_0$ shows that  the NN force is attractive at least for the $^1S_0$ partial wave. 
* It has a short range and strong intermediate attraction.
* Spin dependent, scattering lengths for triplet and singlet states are different,
* Spin-orbit force. Observation of large polarizations of scattered nucleons perpendicular to the plane of scattering.

* Strongly repulsive core. The $s$-wave phase shift becomes negative at $\approx 250$ MeV implying that the singlet $S$ has a hard core with range $0.4-0.5$ fm. 
* Charge independence (almost). Two nucleons in a given two-body state always (almost) experience the same force. Modern interactions break charge and isospin symmetry lightly. That means that the pp, neutron-neutron and pn parts of the interaction will be different for the same quantum numbers. 
* Non-central. There is a tensor force. First indications from the quadrupole moment of the deuteron pointing to an admixture in the ground state of both $l=2$ ($^3D_1$) and $l=0$ ($^3S_1$) orbital momenta.

Comparison of the binding energies of
${}^2\mbox{H}$ (deuteron), ${}^3\mbox{H}$ (triton), ${}^4\mbox{He}$ (alpha - particle) show that the nuclear force is of finite range ($1-2$ fm) and very strong within that range.

For nuclei with $A>4$, the energy saturates: Volume and binding energies of nuclei are proportional to the mass number $A$ (as we saw from exercise 1).

Nuclei are also bound. The average distance
between nucleons in nuclei is about $2$ fm which
must roughly correspond to the range of the
attractive part.

When solving the scattering equation or solving the two-nucleon problem, it is convenient to rewrite the Schroedinger equation, due to
the spherical symmetry of the Hamiltonian, in relative and center-of-mass coordinates. This will also define the quantum numbers of the relative and center-of-mass system and will aid us later in solving
the so-called Lippman-Schwinger equation for the scattering problem. 

We define the center-of-mass (CoM)  momentum as

with $\hbar=c=1$ the wave number $k_i=p_i$, with $p_i$ the pertinent momentum of a single-particle state.

===== Relative and CoM system, quantum numbers =====

Since the two-nucleon interaction depends only on the relative distance, this means that we can separate Schroedinger's equation in an equation for the center-of-mass motion and one for the relative motion.

With an equation for the relative motion only and a separate one for the center-of-mass motion we need to redefine the two-body quantum numbers.

Previously we had a two-body state vector defined as $|(j_1j_2)JM_J\rangle$ in a coupled basis. 
We will now define the quantum numbers for the relative motion. Here we need to define new orbital momenta (since these are the quantum numbers which change). 
We define 
!bt
\[
\hat{l}_1+\hat{l}_2=\hat{\lambda}=\hat{l}+\hat{L},
\]
!et
where $\hat{l}$ is the orbital momentum associated with the relative motion and
$\hat{L}$ the corresponding one linked with the CoM. The total spin $S$ is unchanged since it acts in a different space. We have thus that
!bt
\[
\hat{J}=\hat{l}+\hat{L}+\hat{S},
\]
!et
which allows us to define the angular momentum of the relative motion
!bt
\[
{ \cal J} =  \hat{l}+\hat{S},
\]

The total two-nucleon state function has to be anti-symmetric. The total function contains a spatial part, a spin part and an isospin part. If isospin is conserved, this leads to in case we have an $s$-wave with spin $S=0$ to an isospin 
two-body state with $T=1$ since the spatial part is symmetric and the spin part is anti-symmetric. 

Since the projections for $T$ are $T_z=-1,0,1$, we can have a $pp$, an $nn$ and a $pn$ state.

For $l=0$ and $S=1$, a so-called triplet state, $^3S_1$, we must have $T=0$, meaning that we have only one state, a $pn$ state. For other partial waves, the following table lists states up to $f$ waves.
We can systemize this in a table as follows, recalling that $|\mathbf{l}-\mathbf{S}| \le |\mathbf{J}| \le |\mathbf{l}+\mathbf{S}|$,

When we look at the expectation value of

spin $\mathbf{S}=\mathbf{s}_1+\mathbf{s}_2$, resulting in 
!bt

\langle\mathbf{\sigma}_1\cdot\mathbf{\sigma}_2\rangle=2(S^2-s_1^2-s_2^2)=2S(S+1)-3,

which means that for $s$-waves with either $S=0$ and thereby $J=0$ or $S=1$ and $J=1$, 
the expectation value for the
spin-orbit force is zero. With the above phenomenological model, the
only contributions to the expectation value of the potential energy for $s$-waves
stem  from the central and the spin-spin components since the
expectation value of the tensor force is also zero.

!bblock References for Various Phenomenological Interactions

From 1950 till approximately 2000: One-Boson-Exchange (OBE) models dominate. These are models which typically include several low-mass mesons, that is with masses below 1 GeV.   Potentials which are based upon the standard non-relativistic operator structure
 are called "Phenomenological Potentials" Some historically important examples are   
* Gammel-Thaler potential ( Phys. Rev. _107_, 291, 1339 (1957) and the 
* Hamada-Johnston potential, Nucl. Phys. _34_, 382 (1962)), both with a hard core.
* Reid potential (Ann. Phys. (N.Y.) _50_, 411 (1968)), soft core.
* Argonne $V_{14}$ potential (Wiringa et al., Phys. Rev. C _29_, 1207 (1984)) with 14 operators and  the  Argonne $V_{18}$ potential (Wiringa et al., Phys. Rev. C _51_, 38 (1995)), uses 18 operators
* A good historical reference: R.~Machleidt, Adv.~Nucl.~Phys.  _19_, 189 (1989).

Now: models based on chiral perturbation theory. These are effective models with nucleons and pions as degrees of freedom only. The other mesons which appeared in standard one-boson model appear as multi-pion resonances.

The total two-nucleon state function has to be anti-symmetric. The total function contains a spatial part, a spin part and an isospin part. If isospin is conserved, this leads to in case we have an $s$-wave with spin $S=0$ to an isospin 
two-body state with $T=1$ since the spatial part is symmetric and the spin part is anti-symmetric. 

Since the projections for $T$ are $T_z=-1,0,1$, we can have a $pp$, an $nn$ and a $pn$ state.

For $l=0$ and $S=1$, a so-called triplet state, $^3S_1$, we must have $T=0$, meaning that we have only one state, a $pn$ state. For other partial waves, see exercises below.

Let us look closer at specific partial waves for which one-pion exchange is applicable. If we have $S=0$ and $T=0$, the 
orbital momentum has to be an odd number in order for the total anti-symmetry to be obeyed. For $S=0$, the tensor force component is zero, meaning that 
the only contribution is 
!bt
\[
V_{\pi}(\mathbf{r})=\frac{3f_{\pi}^{2}}{4\pi m_{\pi}^{2}}\frac{e^{-m_\pi r}}{m_\pi r},
\]

since $\langle\mathbf{ \sigma}_1\cdot\mathbf{ \sigma}_2\rangle=-3$, that is we obtain a repulsive contribution to partial waves like

while for $S=1$ and $T=1$, $l$ can only take odd values, resulting in a repulsive contribution 
!bt
\[
V_{\pi}(\mathbf{r})= \frac{1}{3}\frac{f_{\pi}^{2}}{4\pi m_{\pi}^{2}}\left(1+( 1 + {3\over m_\pi r} + {3\over\left(m_\pi r\right)^2}) S_{12} (\hat r)\right) \frac{e^{-m_\pi r}}{m_\pi r}.

The central part of one-pion exchange interaction, arising from the spin-spin term,  
is thus attractive for $s$-waves and all even $l$ values. For $p$-waves and all other odd values
it is repulsive. However, its overall strength is weak. This is discussed further in one of exercises below.

* At large intermediate distances pion exchange dominates while  pion resonances (other mesons) dominate at intermediate and short range 
*  Potentials are parameterized to fit selected two-nucleon data, binding energies and scattering phase shifts.
* Nowaydays, chiral perturbation theory gives an effective theory that allows a systematic expansion in terms of contrallable parameters. Good basis for many-body physics

This will lead us to the so-called Lippman-Schwinger equation for the scattering problem and a rewrite of Schroedinger's equation in relative and center-of-mass coordinates. 


Before we break down the Schroedinger equation into a partial wave decomposition, we derive now the so-called Lippman-Schwinger equation. We will do this in an operator form first.

Here it is assumed that the potential interaction does not contain any spin dependence. 
Instead of a differential equation in coordinate space, the Schroedinger
equation becomes an integral equation in momentum space. This has 
many tractable features. Firstly, most realistic 
nucleon-nucleon interactions derived from field-theory are given 
explicitly in momentum space. Secondly, the boundary conditions imposed
on the differential equation in coordinate space are automatically built into the
integral equation. And last, but not least, integral equations are easy to numerically 
implement, and convergence is obtained by just increasing the number of integration
points.
Instead of solving the three-dimensional integral equation, an 
infinite set of 1-dimensional equations can be obtained via a  partial wave

For scattering states, the energy is positive, $E>0$. 
The Lippman-Schwinger equation (a rewrite of the Schroedinger equation)
is an integral equation
where we have to deal with the amplitude 
$R(k,k')$ (reaction matrix, which is the real part of  the full
complex $T$-matrix)
defined through the integral equation for one partial wave (no coupled-channels) 
!bt
\begin{equation}
    R_l(k,k') = V_l(k,k') +\frac{2}{\pi}{\cal P}
                \int_0^{\infty}dqq^2V_l(k,q)\frac{1}{E-q^2/m}R_l(q,k').

From now on we will drop the subscript $l$ in all equations.
In order to solve the Lippman-Schwinger equation 
in momentum space, we need first to write 
a function which sets up the mesh points. 
We need to do that since we are going to approximate an integral
through 
!bt
\[
   \int_a^bf(x)dx\approx\sum_{i=1}^Nw_if(x_i),
\]
!et
where we have fixed $N$ lattice points through the corresponding weights
$w_i$ and points $x_i$. Typically obtained via methods like Gaussian quadrature.

If you use Gauss-Legendre the points are determined for the interval $x_i\in [-1,1]$
You map these points over to the limits in your integral. You can then
use the following mapping

The principal value integral is rather tricky
to evaluate numerically, mainly since computers have limited
precision. We will here use a subtraction trick often used
when dealing with singular integrals in numerical calculations.
We introduce first the calculus relation
!bt
\[
  \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{dk}{k-k_0} =0.
\]
!et
It means that the curve $1/(k-k_0)$ has equal and opposite
areas on both sides of the singular point $k_0$. If we break
the integral into one over positive $k$ and one over 
negative $k$, a change of variable $k\rightarrow -k$ 
allows us to rewrite the last equation as
!bt
\[
  \int_{0}^{\infty} \frac{dk}{k^2-k_0^2} =0.
\]
!et
!eblock

!split
===== The Lippman-Schwinger equation for two-nucleon scattering =====

We can then express a principal values integral
as
!bt
\begin{equation}
  {\cal P}\int_{0}^{\infty} \frac{f(k)dk}{k^2-k_0^2} =
  \int_{0}^{\infty} \frac{(f(k)-f(k_0))dk}{k^2-k_0^2},
   label{eq:trick}
\end{equation}
!et
where the right-hand side is no longer singular at 
$k=k_0$, it is proportional to the derivative $df/dk$,
and can be evaluated numerically as any other integral.
!eblock

!split
===== The Lippman-Schwinger equation for two-nucleon scattering =====

We can then use this trick to obtain
!bt
\begin{equation}
    R(k,k') = V(k,k') +\frac{2}{\pi}
                \int_0^{\infty}dq
                \frac{q^2V(k,q)R(q,k')-k_0^2V(k,k_0)R(k_0,k')  }

to calculate the phase shifts. We are interested in obtaining

Using the mesh points $k_j$ and the weights $\omega_j$,
         we reach

This equation contains now the unknowns $R(k_i,k_j)$
(with dimension $N\times N$) and $R(k_0,k_0)$.

We can turn it into an equation
with dimension $(N+1)\times (N+1)$ with  a mesh
which contains the original mesh points $k_j$ for $j=1,N$
and the point which corresponds to the energy $k_0$.
Consider the latter as the 'observable' point.
The mesh points become then $k_j$ for $j=1,n$ and
$k_{N+1}=k_0$. 

With these new mesh points we define the matrix
!bt
\begin{equation}
      A_{i,j}=\delta_{i,j}-V(k_i,k_j)u_j,
      label{eq:aeq}

The first task is then to 
set up the matrix $A$ for a given $k_0$. This is an
$(N+1)\times (N+1)$ matrix. It can be convenient
to have an outer loop which runs over the chosen
observable values for the energy $k_0^2/m$.
{\em Note that all mesh points $k_j$ for $j=1,N$ must be
different from $k_0$. Note also that
$V(k_i,k_j)$ is an
$(N+1)\times (N+1)$ matrix}. 

With the matrix $A$ we can rewrite the problem as a matrix problem of dimension $(N+1)\times (N+1)$.
All matrices $R$, $A$ and $V$ have this dimension and we get
!bt
\[
    A_{i,l}R_{l,j}=V_{i,j},

!bt
\[

===== The Lippman-Schwinger equation for two-nucleon scattering =====
!bblock
Since you already have defined $A$ and $V$
(these are stored as $(N+1)\times (N+1)$ matrices) 
The final equation involves only the unknown
$R$. We obtain it by matrix inversion, i.e.,
!bt
\begin{equation}
    R=A^{-1}V.
    label{eq:final2}
\end{equation}
!et
Thus, to obtain $R$, you will need to set up the matrices
$A$ and $V$ and invert the matrix $A$. 
With the inverse $A^{-1}$, perform
a matrix multiplication with $V$ results in $R$.

With $R$ you can then evaluate the phase shifts
by noting that 
!bt
\[

\]

where $\delta$ are the phase shifts.

For elastic scattering, the scattering potential can only change the outgoing spherical wave function up to a phase. In the asymptotic limit, far away from the scattering potential, we get for the spherical bessel function
!bt
\[
j_l(kr) \xrightarrow[]{ r \gg 1} \frac{\sin(kr -l\pi/2)}{kr} =  \frac{1}{2ik}\left( \frac{e^{i(kr-l\pi/2)}}{r} - \frac{e^{-i(kr-l\pi/2)}}{r}\right)
\]
!et
The outgoing wave will change by a phase shift $\delta_l$, from which we can define the S-matrix $S_l(k) = e^{2i\delta_l(k)}$. Thus, we have
!bt
\[
 \frac{e^{i(kr-l\pi/2)}}{r} \xrightarrow[]{\mathrm{phase change}}  \frac{S_l(k)e^{i(kr-l\pi/2)}}{r}

!bt
\[

\]
!et
Using the expansion of a plane wave in spherical waves, we can relate the scattering amplitude $f(\theta)$ with the partial wave phase shifts $\delta_l$ by identifying the outgoing wave 
!bt
\[

which can be simplified further by cancelling $i^l$ with $e^{-il\pi/2}$ 
!eblock

The integrated cross section is given by
\[

\]
\[
=2\pi \sum_l |\frac{(2l+1)}{k} \sin(\delta_l)|^2 \int_0^{\pi} (P_l(\cos(\theta)))^2 \sin(\theta) d\theta\]
\[ 
= \frac{4\pi}{k^2} \sum_l (2l+1) \sin^2\delta_l(k) = 4\pi \sum_l (2l+1)|f_l(\theta)|^2, 
\]
where the orthogonality of the Legendre polynomials was used to evaluate the last integral
\[
\int_0^{\pi} P_l(\cos \theta)^2 \sin \theta d\theta = \frac{2}{2l+1}.
\]
Thus, the _total_ cross section is the sum of the partial-wave cross sections. Note that the differential cross section contains cross-terms from different partial waves. The integral over the full sphere enables the use of the legendre orthogonality, and this kills the cross-terms.

At low energy, $k \rightarrow 0$, S-waves are most important. In this region we can define the scattering length $a$ and the effective range $r$. The $S-$wave scattering amplitude is given by
\[
f_l(\theta) = \frac{1}{k}\frac{1}{\cot \delta_l(k) - i}.
\]
Taking the limit $k \rightarrow 0$, gives us the expansion
\[
k \cot \delta_0 = -\frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{2}r_0 k^2 + \ldots
\]
Thus the low energy cross section is given by
\[
\sigma = 4\pi a^2.
\]
If the system contains a bound state, the scattering length will become positive (neutron-proton in $^3S_1$). For the $^1S_0$ wave, the scattering length is negative and large. This indicates that the wave function of the system is at the verge of turning over to get a node, but cannot create a bound state in this wave.

It is important to realize that the phase shifts themselves are not
observables. The measurable scattering quantity is the cross section,
or the differential cross section. The partial wave phase shifts can
be thought of as a parameterization of the (experimental) cross
sections. The phase shifts provide insights into the physics of
partial wave projected nuclear interactions, and are thus important
quantities to know.

The nucleon-nucleon differential cross section
have been measured at almost all energies up to the pion production
threshold (290 MeV in the Lab frame), and this experimental data base
is what provides us with the constraints on our nuclear interaction
models. In order to pin down the unknown coupling constants of the
theory, a statistical optimization with respect to cross sections need
to be carried out. This is how we constrain the nucleon-nucleon
interaction in practice!

A simple parametrization of the nucleon-nucleon force is given by what is called the $V_8$ potential model,
where we have kept eight different operators. These operators contain a central force, a spin-orbit force,
a spin-spin force and a tensor force. Several features of the nuclei can be explained in terms of these four components. Without the Pauli matrices for isospin the final form of such an interaction model results in the following form: 
!bt
\[
V(\mathbf{r})= \left\{ C_c + C_\mathbf{\sigma} \mathbf{\sigma}_1\cdot\mathbf{\sigma}_2
 + C_T \left( 1 + {3\over m_\alpha r} + {3\over\left(m_\alpha r\right)^2}\right) S_{12} (\hat r)\right. 
\]
!et
!bt
\[
\left. + C_{SL} \left( {1\over m_\alpha r} + {1\over \left( m_\alpha r\right)^2}
\right) \mathbf{L}\cdot \mathbf{S}
\right\} \frac{e^{-m_\alpha r}}{m_\alpha r}
\]
!et
where $m_{\alpha}$ is the mass of the relevant meson and
$S_{12}$ is the familiar tensor term. The various coefficients $C_i$ are normally fitted so that the potential reproduces experimental scattering cross sections. By adding terms which include the isospin Pauli matrices 
results in an interaction model with eight operators.

The expectaction value of the tensor operator is non-zero only for $S=1$. We will show this in a forthcoming lecture, after that we have derived the Wigner-Eckart theorem. 
Here it suffices to know that the expectaction value of the tensor force for different partial values is  (with $l$ the orbital angular momentum and ${\cal J}$ the total angular momentum in the relative and center-of-mass frame of motion)
!bt

and zero else.   

In this exercise we will focus only on the one-pion exchange term of the nuclear force, namely
!bt
\[
V_{\pi}(\mathbf{r})= -\frac{f_{\pi}^{2}}{4\pi m_{\pi}^{2}}\mathbf{ \tau}_1\cdot\mathbf{\tau}_2
\frac{1}{3}\left\{\mathbf{ \sigma}_1\cdot\mathbf{ \sigma}_2+\left( 1 + {3\over m_\pi r} + {3\over\left(m_\pi r\right)^2}\right) S_{12} (\hat r)\right\} \frac{e^{-m_\pi r}}{m_\pi r}.
\]
!et
Here the constant $f_{\pi}^{2}/4\pi\approx 0.08$ and the mass of the pion is $m_\pi\approx 140$ MeV/c${}^{2}$. 

 o Compute the expectation value of the tensor force and the spin-spin  and isospin operators for the one-pion exchange potential for all partial waves you found in exercise 9. Comment your results. How does the one-pion exchange part behave as function of different $l$, ${\cal J}$ and $S$ values? Do you see some patterns?
 o For the binding energy of the deuteron, with the ground state defined by the quantum numbers $l=0$, $S=1$ and ${\cal J}=1$, the tensor force plays an important role due to the admixture from the $l=2$ state. Use the expectation values of the different operators of the one-pion exchange potential and plot the ratio of the tensor force component over the spin-spin component of the one-pion exchange part as function of $x=m_\pi r$ for the $l=2$ state (that is the case $l,l'={\cal J}+1$). Comment your results.
