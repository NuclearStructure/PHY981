The potential energy term due to the attraction of the nucleus defines the onebody field $u_i=u_{\mathrm{ext}}(x_i)$ of Eq.~(ref{eq:firstv}).
We have moved this term into the $\hat{H}_0$ part of the Hamiltonian, instead of keeping  it in $\hat{V}$ as in  Eq.~(ref{eq:firstv}).
The reason is that we will hereafter treat $\hat{H}_0$ as our non-interacting  Hamiltonian. For a many-body wavefunction $\Phi_{\lambda}$ defined by an  
appropriate single-particle basis, we may solve exactly the non-interacting eigenvalue problem 
!bt 
\[
\hat{H}_0\Phi_{\lambda}= w_{\lambda}\Phi_{\lambda},
\]
!et
with $w_{\lambda}$ being the non-interacting energy. This energy is defined by the sum over single-particle energies to be defined below.
For atoms the single-particle energies could be the hydrogen-like single-particle energies corrected for the charge $Z$. For nuclei and quantum
dots, these energies could be given by the harmonic oscillator in three and two dimensions, respectively.

We will assume that the interacting part of the Hamiltonian
can be approximated by a two-body interaction.
This means that our Hamiltonian is written as 
!bt
\begin{equation}
    \hat{H} = \hat{H}_0 + \hat{H}_I 
    = \sum_{i=1}^A \hat{h}_0(x_i) + \sum_{i < j}^A V(r_{ij}),

label{hinuclei}
\end{equation}

The onebody part $u_{\mathrm{ext}}(x_i)$ is normally approximated by a harmonic oscillator potential or the Coulomb interaction an electron feels from the nucleus. However, other potentials are fully possible, such as 
one derived from the self-consistent solution of the Hartree-Fock equations.

Our Hamiltonian is invariant under the permutation (interchange) of two particles. % (exercise here, prove it)
Since we deal with fermions however, the total wave function is antisymmetric.
Let $\hat{P}$ be an operator which interchanges two particles.
Due to the symmetries we have ascribed to our Hamiltonian, this operator commutes with the total Hamiltonian,
!bt 
\[
[\hat{H},\hat{P}] = 0,
 \]
!et
meaning that $\Psi_{\lambda}(x_1, x_2, \dots , x_N)$ is an eigenfunction of 
$\hat{P}$ as well, that is
!bt 
\[
\hat{P}_{ij}\Psi_{\lambda}(x_1, x_2, \dots,x_i,\dots,x_j,\dots,x_A)=
\beta\Psi_{\lambda}(x_1, x_2, \dots,x_i,\dots,x_j,\dots,x_A),
\]
!et
where $\beta$ is the eigenvalue of $\hat{P}$. We have introduced the suffix $ij$ in order to indicate that we permute particles $i$ and $j$.
The Pauli principle tells us that the total wave function for a system of fermions
has to be antisymmetric, resulting in the eigenvalue $\beta = -1$.

The energies $\varepsilon_{\alpha}$ are the so-called non-interacting single-particle energies, or unperturbed energies.
