The potential energy term due to the attraction of the nucleus defines the onebody field $u_i=u_{\mathrm{ext}}(x_i)$ of Eq.~(ref{eq:firstv}).
We have moved this term into the $\hat{H}_0$ part of the Hamiltonian, instead of keeping  it in $\hat{V}$ as in  Eq.~(ref{eq:firstv}).
The reason is that we will hereafter treat $\hat{H}_0$ as our non-interacting  Hamiltonian. For a many-body wavefunction $\Phi_{\lambda}$ defined by an  
appropriate single-particle basis, we may solve exactly the non-interacting eigenvalue problem 
!bt 
\[
\hat{H}_0\Phi_{\lambda}= w_{\lambda}\Phi_{\lambda},
\]
!et
with $w_{\lambda}$ being the non-interacting energy. This energy is defined by the sum over single-particle energies to be defined below.
For atoms the single-particle energies could be the hydrogen-like single-particle energies corrected for the charge $Z$. For nuclei and quantum
dots, these energies could be given by the harmonic oscillator in three and two dimensions, respectively.

We will assume that the interacting part of the Hamiltonian
can be approximated by a two-body interaction.
This means that our Hamiltonian is written as

The onebody part $u_{\mathrm{ext}}(x_i)$ is normally approximated by a harmonic oscillator potential or the Coulomb interaction an electron feels from the nucleus. However, other potentials are fully possible, such as 
one derived from the self-consistent solution of the Hartree-Fock equations.

Our Hamiltonian is invariant under the permutation (interchange) of two particles. % (exercise here, prove it)
Since we deal with fermions however, the total wave function is antisymmetric.
Let $\hat{P}$ be an operator which interchanges two particles.
Due to the symmetries we have ascribed to our Hamiltonian, this operator commutes with the total Hamiltonian,
!bt 
\[
[\hat{H},\hat{P}] = 0,
 \]

meaning that $\Psi_{\lambda}(x_1, x_2, \dots , x_N)$ is an eigenfunction of 
$\hat{P}$ as well, that is

\[
\hat{P}_{ij}\Psi_{\lambda}(x_1, x_2, \dots,x_i,\dots,x_j,\dots,x_A)=
\beta\Psi_{\lambda}(x_1, x_2, \dots,x_i,\dots,x_j,\dots,x_A),

where $\beta$ is the eigenvalue of $\hat{P}$. We have introduced the suffix $ij$ in order to indicate that we permute particles $i$ and $j$.
The Pauli principle tells us that the total wave function for a system of fermions
has to be antisymmetric, resulting in the eigenvalue $\beta = -1$.

The energies $\varepsilon_{\alpha}$ are the so-called non-interacting single-particle energies, or unperturbed energies.

=====  Exercise 2 =====
!bblock
We will now consider a simple three-level problem, depicted in the figure below. 
The single-particle states are labelled by the quantum number $p$ and can accomodate up to two single particles, 
viz., every single-particle state 
is doubly degenerate (you could think of this as one state having spin up and the other spin down). 
We let the spacing between the doubly degenerate single-particle states be constant, with value $d$.  The first state
has energy $d$. There are only three available single-particle states, $p=1$, $p=2$ and $p=3$, as illustrated
in the figure. 
* How many two-particle Slater determinants can we construct in this space? 
* We limit ourselves to a system with only the two lowest single-particle orbits and two particles, $p=1$ and $p=2$.
We assume that we can write the Hamiltonian as
!bt
\[
       \hat{H}=\hat{H}_0+\hat{H}_I,
\]
!et
and that the onebody part of the Hamiltonian with single-particle operator $\hat{h}_0$ has the property
!bt
\[
\hat{h}_0\psi_{p\sigma} = p\times d \psi_{p\sigma},
\]
!et
where we have added a spin quantum number $\sigma$. 
We assume also that the only two-particle states that can exist are those where two particles are in the 
same state $p$, as shown by the two possibilities to the left in the figure.
The two-particle matrix elements of $\hat{H}_I$ have all a constant value, $-g$.
Show then that the Hamiltonian matrix can be written as 
!bt
\[
\left(\begin{array}{cc}2d-g &-g \\
-g &4d-g \end{array}\right),
\]
!et
and find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors.  What is mixing of the state with two particles in $p=2$ 
to the wave function with two-particles in $p=1$? Discuss your results in terms of a linear combination
of Slater determinants. 
* Add the possibility that the two particles can be in the state with $p=3$ as well and find the Hamiltonian
matrix, the eigenvalues and the eigenvectors. We still insist that we only have two-particle states composed of two particles being in the same
level $p$. You can diagonalize numerically your $3\times 3$ matrix.

This simple model catches several birds with a stone. It demonstrates how we can build linear combinations
of Slater determinants and interpret these as different admixtures to a given state. It represents also the way we are going to interpret these contributions.  The two-particle states above $p=1$ will be interpreted as 
excitations from the ground state configuration, $p=1$ here.  The reliability of this ansatz for the ground state, 
with two particles in $p=1$,
depends on the strength of the interaction $g$ and the single-particle spacing $d$.
Finally, this model is a simple schematic ansatz for studies of pairing correlations and thereby superfluidity/superconductivity  
in fermionic systems.
