===== Motivation ===== 
!bblock Stability of matter
To understand why matter is stable, and thereby shed light on the limits of 
nuclear stability, is one of the 
overarching aims and intellectual challenges 
of basic research in nuclear physics. To relate the stability of matter
to the underlying fundamental forces and particles of nature as manifested in nuclear matter, is central
to present and planned rare isotope facilities. 
Important properties of nuclear systems which can reveal information about these topics 
are for example masses, and thereby binding energies, and density distributions of nuclei.  
These are quantities which convey important information on 
the shell structure of nuclei, with their 
pertinent magic numbers and shell closures or the  eventual disappearence of the latter 
away from  the valley of stability.

===== Motivation ===== 
!bblock 

Neutron-rich nuclei are particularly interesting for the above endeavour. As a particular chain
of isotopes becomes more and more neutron rich, one reaches finally the limit of stability, the so-called
dripline, where one additional neutron makes the next isotopes unstable with respect 
to the previous ones. The appearence or not of magic numbers and shell structures,
the formation of neutron skins and halos
can thence be probed via investigations of quantities like  the binding energy
or the charge radii and neutron rms radii of neutron-rich nuclei. 
These quantities have in turn important 
consequences for theoretical models of nuclear structure and their application in astrophysics.
For example, the neutron radius of $^{208}$Pb, recently extracted from the PREX 
experiment at Jefferson Laboratory  can be used to constrain the equation of state of 
neutron matter. A related quantity to the
neutron rms radius $r_n^{\mathrm{rms}}=\langle r^2\rangle_n^{1/2}$ is the neutron skin 
$r_{\mathrm{skin}}=r_n^{\mathrm{rms}}-r_p^{\mathrm{rms}}$,
where $r_p^{\mathrm{rms}}$ is the corresponding proton rms radius.  
There are several properties which relate the thickness of the neutron skin to quantities in nuclei and 
nuclear matter, such as the symmetry energy at the saturation point for nuclear matter, the slope
of the equation of state for neutron matter
% the list is not conclusive, biased ref to be corrected with more later if we wish to keep
or the low-energy electric dipole strength due to the pigmy dipole resonance.

===== Motivation ===== 
!bblock 
Having access to precise measurements of masses, radii, and
electromagnetic moments for a wide range of nuclei allows to study
trends with varying neutron excess. A quantitative description of
various experimental data with quantified uncertainty still remains a
major challenge for nuclear structure theory.  Global theoretical
studies of isotopic chains, such as the Ca chain shown in the figure below here, make it possible to test systematic
properties of effective nuclear interactions. Such calculations also
provide critical tests of limitations of many-body methods. As one
approaches the particle emission thresholds, it becomes increasingly
important to describe correctly the coupling to the continuum of
decays and scattering channels. While the
full treatment of antisymmetrization and short-range correlations has
become routine in {\em ab initio} approaches to nuclear bound states, the
many-body problem becomes more difficult when long-range correlations
and continuum effects are considered.

===== Motivation ===== 
!bblock 

The aim of this first section is to present some of the experimental data which can be used to extract 
information about correlations in nuclear systems. In particular, we will start with a theoretical analysis of a quantity called the neutron or proton separation energy. This quantity, to be discussed below, is defined as the difference between two binding energies (masses) of neighboring nuclei. As we will see from various figures below, the separation energies display a varying behavior as function of the number of neutrons or protons. These variations from one nucleus to another one, laid the foundation for the introduction of so-called magic numbers and a mean-field picture in order to describe nuclei theoretically.

!eblock



!split 
===== Motivation ===== 
!bblock 

With a mean- or average-field picture we mean that a given nucleon (either a proton or a neutron) moves in an average potential field which is set up by all other nucleons in the system. Consider for example a nucleus like $^{17}$O with nine neutrons and eight protons. Many properties  of this nucleus can be interpreted in terms of a picture where we can view it as
one neutron on top of $^{16}$O. We infer from data and our theoretical interpretations that this additional neutron behaves almost as an individual neutron which *sees* an average interaction set up by the remaining 16 nucleons in   $^{16}$O. Oxygen-16 is an example of what we in this course will denote as a good closed-shell nucleus. We will come back to what this means later.

Since we want to develop a theory capable of interpreting data in terms of our laws of motion and the pertinent forces,
we can think of this neutron as a particle which moves in a potential field. We can hence attempt at solving our equations of motions (Schroedinger's equation) for this system along the same lines as we did in atomic physics when we solved Schroedinger's equation for the hydrogen atom. We just need define a model for our effective single-particle potential. 

A simple potential model which enjoys quite some popularity in nuclear physics, is the three-dimensional harmonic oscillator. This potential model captures some of the physics of deeply bound single-particle states but fails in reproducing 
the less bound single-particle. A parametrized, and more realistic,  potential model which is widely used in nuclear physics, is the so-called Woods-Saxon potential. Both the harmonic oscillator and the Woods-Saxon potential models define easy computational problems, resulting (with the appropriate parameters) in a rather good reproduction of experiment for nuclei which can be approximated as one nucleon on top of the remaining nucleons.

!eblock


!split 
===== Motivation ===== 
!bblock 

To be able to interpret a nucleus in such  a way requires at least that we are capable of parametrizing the abovementioned
interactions in order to reproduce say the excitation spectrum of a nucleus like $^{17}$O. 

With such a parametrized interaction we are thus able to solve Schroedinger's equation for the motion of one nucleon in a given field. A nucleus is however a true and complicated many-nucleon system, with extremely many degrees of freedom, rendering the ideal solution of the many-nucleon Schroedinger equation an impossible enterprise. It is much easier to solve a single-particle problem with say a Woods-Saxon potential. Using such a potential hides however many of the complicated correlations and interactions which we see in nuclei. Such an effective single-nucleon potential is not capable of 
describing properties like the binding energy or the rms radius of a given nucleus. 

An improvement to these simpler single-nucleon potentials is given by the Hartree-Fock method, where the variational principle is used to define a mean-field which the nucleons move in. There are many different classes of mean-field methods.
An important difference between these methods and the simpler parametrized mean-field potentials like the harmonic oscillator and the Woods-Saxon potentials, is that the resulting equations contain information about the nuclear forces present in our models for solving Schroedinger's equation.

!split 
===== Motivation ===== 
!bblock 
The aim of this section is to present some of the experimental data we will confront theory with. In particular we will focus on separation energies and use these to build a picture of nuclei in terms of (from a philosophical stand we would call this  a reductionist approach) a single-particle picture. The harmonic oscillator will serve as an excellent starting point in building nuclei from the bottom and up. Here we will neglect nuclear forces, these are introduced in the next section when we discuss the Hartree-Fock method. 

The aim of this course is to develop our physics intuition of nuclear systems using  a theoretical approach  where we describe data in terms of 
the motion of individual nucleons and their mutual interactions. How our theoretical pictures and models can be used to interpret data is in essence what this course is about. Our narrative will lead us along a path where we start with single-particle models and end with the theory of the nuclear shell-model. The latter will be used to understand analyze excitation spectra and decay patters of nuclei, linking our theoretical understanding with interpretations of experiment.

===== Motivation ===== 
!bblock Do we understand the physics of dripline systems?

We start our tour of experimental data and our interpretations by considering the chain of oxygen isotopes.
The oxygen isotopes are the heaviest isotopes for which the drip line is well established.  They are simple enough to be described by some few selected single-particle degrees of freedom.  

* Two out of four stable even-even isotopes exhibit a doubly magic nature, namely $^{22}$O ($Z=8$, $N=14$) and $^{24}$O ($Z=8$, $N=16$).
* The structure of $^{22}$O and $^{24}$O is assumed to be governed by the evolution of the $1s_{1/2}$ and $0d_{5/2}$  one-quasiparticle states.
* The isotopes $^{25}$O, $^{26}$O, $^{27}$O and $^{28}$O are outside the drip line, since the $0d_{3/2}$ orbit is not bound.

===== Motivation ===== 
!bblock Do we understand the physics of dripline systems?
Our first approach in analyzing data theoretically, is to see if we can use experimental information to 

* Extract information about a *so-called* single-particle  behavior
* And interpret such a behavior in terms of the underlying forces and microscopic physics

The next step is to see if we could use these interpretations to say something about shell closures and magic numbers. Since we focus on single-particle properties, a quantity we can extract from experiment is the separation energy for protons and neutrons. Before we proceed, we need to define quantities like masses and binding energies.   An excellent review on 
recent trends in the determination of nuclear masses can be found in URL: "http://journals.aps.org/rmp/abstract/10.1103/RevModPhys.75.1021"

!split 
===== Masses and Binding energies ===== 
!bblock
A basic quantity which can be measured for the ground states of nuclei is the atomic mass $M(N, Z)$ of the neutral atom with atomic mass number $A$ and charge $Z$. The number of neutrons are $N$.

Atomic masses are usually tabulated in terms of the mass excess defined by
!bt
\[
\Delta M(N, Z) =  M(N, Z) - uA,
\]
!et
where $u$ is the Atomic Mass Unit 
!bt
\[
u = M(^{12}\mathrm{C})/12 = 931.49386 \hspace{0.1cm} \mathrm{MeV}/c^2.
\]
!et
In this course we will mainly use 
data from the 2003 compilation of Audi, Wapstra and Thibault.  
!eblock

!split 
===== Masses and Binding energies ===== 
!bblock
The nucleon masses are
!bt
\[
m_p = 938.27203(8)\hspace{0.1cm} \mathrm{MeV}/c^2 = 1.00727646688(13)u,
\]
!et
and
!bt 
\[
m_n = 939.56536(8)\hspace{0.1cm} \mathrm{MeV}/c^2 = 1.0086649156(6)u.
\]
!et
In the 2003 mass evaluation there are 2127 nuclei measured with an accuracy of 0.2
MeV or better, and 101 nuclei measured with an accuracy of greater than 0.2 MeV. For
heavy nuclei one observes several chains of nuclei with a constant $N-Z$ value whose masses are obtained from the energy released in $\alpha$-decay.
!eblock


!split 
===== Masses and Binding energies ===== 
!bblock
The nuclear binding energy is defined as the energy required to break up a given nucleus
into its constituent parts of $N$ neutrons and $Z$ protons. In terms of the atomic masses $M(N, Z)$ the binding energy is defined by
!bt
\[
BE(N, Z) = ZM_H c^2 + Nm_n c^2 - M(N, Z)c^2 ,
\]
!et
where $M_H$ is the mass of the hydrogen atom and $m_n$ is the mass of the neutron.
In terms of the mass excess the binding energy is given by
!bt
\[
BE(N, Z) = Z\Delta_H c^2 + N\Delta_n c^2 -\Delta(N, Z)c^2 ,
\]
!et
where $\Delta_H c^2 = 7.2890$ MeV and $\Delta_n c^2 = 8.0713$ MeV.

===== Liquid drop model as a simple parametrization of binding energies  =====
!bblock 

A popular and physically intuitive model which can be used to parametrize 
the experimental binding energies as function of $A$, is the so-called 
the liquid drop model. The ansatz is based on the following expression
!bt
\[ 
BE(N,Z) = a_1A-a_2A^{2/3}-a_3\frac{Z^2}{A^{1/3}}-a_4\frac{(N-Z)^2}{A},
\]
!et
where $A$ stands for the number of nucleons and the $a_i$s are parameters which are determined by a fit 
to the experimental data.  
!eblock


!split
===== Liquid drop model as a simple parametrization of binding energies  =====
!bblock 
To arrive at the above expression we have assumed that we can make the following assumptions:

 * There is a volume term $a_1A$ proportional with the number of nucleons (the energy is also an extensive quantity). When an assembly of nucleons of the same size is packed together into the smallest volume, each interior nucleon has a certain number of other nucleons in contact with it. This contribution is proportional to the volume.

 * There is a surface energy term $a_2A^{2/3}$. The assumption here is that a nucleon at the surface of a nucleus interacts with fewer other nucleons than one in the interior of the nucleus and hence its binding energy is less. This surface energy term takes that into account and is therefore negative and is proportional to the surface area.


 * There is a Coulomb energy term $a_3\frac{Z^2}{A^{1/3}}$. The electric repulsion between each pair of protons in a nucleus yields less binding. 

 * There is an asymmetry term $a_4\frac{(N-Z)^2}{A}$. This term is associated with the Pauli exclusion principle and reflectd the fact that the proton-neutron interaction is more attractive on the average than the neutron-neutron and proton-proton interactions.

We could also add a so-called pairing term, which is a correction term that
arises from the tendency of proton pairs and neutron pairs to
occur. An even number of particles is more stable than an odd number. 
Performing a least-square fit to data, we obtain the following numerical values for the various constants
* $a_1=15.49$ MeV
* $a_2=17.23$ MeV
* $a_3=0.697$ MeV
* $a_4=22.6$ MeV

We leave it as an exercise to the reader who wishes to perform such a fit, to use the file with the experimental binding energies and perform such a fit.

The following python program reads now in the experimental data on binding energies as well as the results from the above liquid drop model and plots these energies as function of the mass number $A$. One sees that for larger values of $A$, there is a better agreement with data.

!split 
===== $Q$-values and separation energies ===== 
!bblock
We are now interested in interpreting experimental binding energies  in terms of a single-particle picture.
In order to do so, we  consider first energy conservation for nuclear transformations that include, for
example, the fusion of two nuclei $a$ and $b$ into the combined system $c$
!bt
\[
{^{N_a+Z_a}}a+ {^{N_b+Z_b}}b\rightarrow {^{N_c+Z_c}}c
\]
!et
or the decay of nucleus $c$ into two other nuclei $a$ and $b$
!bt
\[
^{N_c+Z_c}c \rightarrow  ^{N_a+Z_a}a+ ^{N_b+Z_b}b
\]
!et
In general we have the reactions
!bt
\[
\sum_i {^{N_i+Z_i}}i \rightarrow  \sum_f {^{N_f+Z_f}}f
\]
!et
We require also that number of protons and neutrons are conserved in the initial stage and final stage, unless we have processes which violate baryon conservation, 
!bt
\[
\sum_iN_i = \sum_f N_f \hspace{0.2cm}\mathrm{and} \hspace{0.2cm}\sum_iZ_i = \sum_f Z_f.
\]
!et

!eblock


!split 
===== $Q$-values and separation energies ===== 
!bblock
This process is characterized by an energy difference called the $Q$ value:
!bt
\[
Q=\sum_i M(N_i, Z_i)c^2-\sum_f M(N_f, Z_f)c^2=\sum_i BE(N_f, Z_f)-\sum_i BE(N_i, Z_i)
\]
!et
Spontaneous decay involves a single initial nuclear state and is allowed if $Q > 0$. In the decay, energy is released in the form of the kinetic energy of the final products. Reactions involving two initial nuclei and are endothermic (a net loss of energy) if $Q < 0$; the reactions are exothermic (a net release of energy) if $Q > 0$.
!eblock


!split 
===== $Q$-values and separation energies ===== 
!bblock
We can consider then the Q values associated with the removal of one or two nucleons from
a nucleus. These are conventionally defined in terms of the one-nucleon and two-nucleon
separation energies. The neutron separation energy is defined as 
!bt
\[
S_n= -Q_n= BE(N,Z)-BE(N-1,Z),
\]
!et
and the proton separation energy reads
!bt
\[
S_p= -Q_p= BE(N,Z)-BE(N,Z-1).
\]
!et
The two-neutron separation energy is defined as
!bt
\[
S_{2n}= -Q_{2n}= BE(N,Z)-BE(N-2,Z),
\]
!et
and  the two-proton separation energy is given by
!bt
\[
S_{2p}= -Q_{2p}= BE(N,Z)-BE(N,Z-2),
\]
!et
!eblock


!split 
=====  Separation energies and energy gaps ===== 
!bblock
Using say the neutron separation energies (alternatively the proton separation energies)
!bt
\[
S_n= -Q_n= BE(N,Z)-BE(N-1,Z),
\]
!et
we can define the so-called energy gap for neutrons (or protons) as 
!bt
\[
\Delta S_n= BE(N,Z)-BE(N-1,Z)-\left(BE(N+1,Z)-BE(N,Z)\right),
\]
!et
or 
!bt
\[
\Delta S_n= 2BE(N,Z)-BE(N-1,Z)-BE(N+1,Z).
\]
!et
This quantity can in turn be used to determine which nuclei are magic or not. 
For protons we would have 
!bt
\[
\Delta S_p= 2BE(N,Z)-BE(N,Z-1)-BE(N,Z+1).
\]
!et
We can also define the two-neutron or two-proton gap as well.

===== Features to be noted  =====
!bblock
Since we will focus in the beginning on single-particle degrees of freedom and mean-field approaches before we
start with nuclear forces and many-body approaches like the nuclear shell-model, there are some features to be noted

* The total binding energy is not that different from the sum of the individual neutron and proton masses. 
One may thus infer that intrinsic properties of nucleons in a nucleus are close to those of free nucleons.
* We note clearly a staggering effect between odd and even isotopes with the even ones being more bound (larger separation energies). We will later link this to strong pairing correlations in nuclei.
* We note also that there are large shell-gaps for some nuclei, meaning that more energy is needed to remove one nucleon. These gaps are used to define so-called magic numbers.

!split
===== Radii  =====
!bblock
The root-mean-square (rms) charge radius has been measured for the ground states of many
nuclei. For a spherical charge density, $\rho(\bm{r})$, the mean-square radius is defined by
!bt
\[
\langle r^2\rangle = \frac{ \int  d \bm{r} \rho(\bm{r}) r^2}{ \int  d \bm{r} \rho(\bm{r})},
\]
!et
and the rms radius is the square root of this quantity denoted by
!bt
\[
R =\sqrt{ \langle r^2\rangle}.
\]
!et
!eblock

!split
===== Radii  =====
!bblock
Radii for most stable
nuclei have been deduced from electron scattering form
factors and/or from the x-ray transition energies of muonic atoms. 
The relative radii for a
series of isotopes can be extracted from the isotope shifts of atomic x-ray transitions.
The rms radius for the nuclear point-proton density, $R_p$ is obtained from the rms charge radius by:
!bt
\[
R_p = \sqrt{R^2_{\mathrm{ch}}- R^2_{\mathrm{corr}}},
\]
!et
where
!bt
\[
R^2_{\mathrm{corr}}= R^2_{\mathrm{op}}+(N/Z)R^2_{\mathrm{on}}+R^2_{\mathrm{rel}},
\]
!et
where $ R_{\mathrm{op}}= 0.875(7)$ fm  is the rms radius of the proton, $R^2_{\mathrm{on}} = 0.116(2)$ fm$^2$ is the
mean-square radius of the neutron and $R^2_{\mathrm{rel}} = 0.033$ fm$^2$ is the relativistic Darwin-Foldy correction. There are also smaller nucleus-dependent relativistic spin-orbit and
mesonic-exchange corrections that should be included.

===== Definitions ===== 
!bblock
An operator is defined as $\hat{O}$ throughout. Unless otherwise specified the number of particles is
always $N$ and $d$ is the dimension of the system.  In nuclear physics
we normally define the total number of particles to be $A=N+Z$, where
$N$ is total number of neutrons and $Z$ the total number of
protons. In case of other baryons such isobars $\Delta$ or various
hyperons such as $\Lambda$ or $\Sigma$, one needs to add their
definitions.  Hereafter, $A$ is reserved for the total number of
particles, unless otherwise specificied.  When we refer to a neutron we will use the label $n$ and when we refer to a proton we will use the label $p$. Unless otherwise specified, we will call these particles for nucleons.

Our Hamiltonian is invariant under the permutation (interchange) of two particles.
Since we deal with fermions however, the total wave function is antisymmetric.
Let $\hat{P}$ be an operator which interchanges two particles.
Due to the symmetries we have ascribed to our Hamiltonian, this operator commutes with the total Hamiltonian,
!bt
\[
[\hat{H},\hat{P}] = 0,
\]
!et
meaning that $\Psi_{\lambda}(x_1, x_2, \dots , x_A)$ is an eigenfunction of 
$\hat{P}$ as well, that is
!bt
\[
\hat{P}_{ij}\Psi_{\lambda}(x_1, x_2, \dots,x_i,\dots,x_j,\dots,x_A)=
\beta\Psi_{\lambda}(x_1, x_2, \dots,x_j,\dots,x_i,\dots,x_A),
\]
!et
where $\beta$ is the eigenvalue of $\hat{P}$. We have introduced the suffix $ij$ in order to indicate that we permute particles $i$ and $j$.
The Pauli principle tells us that the total wave function for a system of fermions
has to be antisymmetric, resulting in the eigenvalue $\beta = -1$.

===== The Woods-Saxon potential  =====
!bblock

We will assume that the interacting part of the Hamiltonian
can be approximated by a two-body interaction.
This means that our Hamiltonian is written as 
!bt
\[
    \hat{H} = \hat{H_0} + \hat{H_I} 
    = \sum_{i=1}^A \hat{h}_0(x_i) + \sum_{i < j=1}^A \hat{v}(x_{ij}),
\]

\[
  H_0=\sum_{i=1}^A \hat{h}_0(x_i) =  \sum_{i=1}^A\left(\hat{t}(x_i) + \hat{u}_{\mathrm{ext}}(x_i)\right).
\]
!et
In nuclear physics the one-body part $u_{\mathrm{ext}}(x_i)$ is often approximated by a harmonic oscillator potential or a
Woods-Saxon potential. However, this is not fully correct, because as we have discussed, nuclei are self-bound systems and there is no external confining potential. *The Hamiltonian $H_0$ cannot be used to compute the binding energy of a nucleus since it is not based on a model for the nuclear forces*. That is, the binding energy is not the sum of the individual single-particle energies.

===== The Woods-Saxon potential  =====
!bblock
The Woods-Saxon potential is a mean field potential for the nucleons (protons and neutrons) 
inside an atomic nucleus. It represent an average potential that a given nucleon feels from  the forces applied on each nucleon. 
The parametrization is
!bt
\[
\hat{u}_{\mathrm{ext}}(r)=-\frac{V_0}{1+\exp{(r-R)/a}},
\]
!et
with $V_0\approx 50$ MeV representing the potential well depth, $a\approx 0.5$ fm 
length representing the "surface thickness" of the nucleus and $R=r_0A^{1/3}$, with $r_0=1.25$ fm and $A$ the number of nucleons.
The value for $r_0$ can be extracted from a fit to data, see for example M.~Kirson, Nucl.~Phys.~A '781', 350 (2007).

* It rapidly approaches zero as $r$ goes to infinity, reflecting the short-distance nature of the strong nuclear force.
* For large $A$, it is approximately flat in the center.
* Nucleons near the surface of the nucleus experience a large force towards the center.

===== The harmonic oscillator Hamiltonian  =====
!bblock
We have defined
!bt
\[
    \hat{H} = \hat{H_0} + \hat{H_I} 
    = \sum_{i=1}^A \hat{h}_0(x_i) + \sum_{i < j=1}^A \hat{v}(x_{ij}),
\]
!et
with 
!bt
\[
  H_0=\sum_{i=1}^A \hat{h}_0(x_i) =  \sum_{i=1}^A\left(\hat{t}(x_i) + \hat{u}_{\mathrm{ext}}(x_i)\right).
\]
!et
As stated in previous slides, 
in nuclear physics the one-body part $u_{\mathrm{ext}}(x_i)$ is often 
approximated by a harmonic oscillator potential. However,  as we also noted with the Woods-Saxon potential there is no 
external confining potential in nuclei. 

What many people do then, is to add and subtract a harmonic oscillator potential,
with 
!bt
\[
\hat{u}_{\mathrm{ext}}(x_i)=\hat{u}_{\mathrm{ho}}(x_i)= \frac{1}{2}m\omega^2 r_i^2,
\]
!et
where $\omega$ is the oscillator frequency. This leads to 
!bt
\[
    \hat{H} = \hat{H_0} + \hat{H_I} 
    = \sum_{i=1}^A \hat{h}_0(x_i) + \sum_{i < j=1}^A \hat{v}(x_{ij})-\sum_{i=1}^A\hat{u}_{\mathrm{ho}}(x_i),
\]

with 
!bt
\[
  H_0=\sum_{i=1}^A \hat{h}_0(x_i) =  \sum_{i=1}^A\left(\hat{t}(x_i) + \hat{u}_{\mathrm{ho}}(x_i)\right).
\]
!et
Many practitioners use this as the standard Hamiltonian when doing nuclear structure calculations. 
This is ok if the number of nucleons is large, but still with this Hamiltonian, we do not obey translational invariance.  How can we cure this?

===== Translationally Invariant Hamiltonian  =====
!bblock
 In setting up a translationally invariant Hamiltonian  
 the following expressions are helpful.
 The center-of-mass (CoM)  momentum is
!bt 
\[
    P=\sum_{i=1}^A\vec{p}_i,
 \]
!et
 and we have that
!bt 
\[
 \sum_{i=1}^A\vec{p}_i^2 =
 \frac{1}{A}\left[\vec{P}^2+\sum_{i < j}(\vec{p}_i-\vec{p}_j)^2\right]
 \]
!et
 meaning that
!bt 
\[
 \left[\sum_{i=1}^A\frac{\vec{p}_i^2}{2m} -\frac{\vec{P}^2}{2mA}\right]
 =\frac{1}{2mA}\sum_{i < j}(\vec{p}_i-\vec{p}_j)^2.
 \]
!et

 In a similar fashion we can define the CoM coordinate
!bt 
\[
     \vec{R}=\frac{1}{A}\sum_{i=1}^{A}\vec{r}_i,
 \]
!et
 which yields
!bt
 \[
 \sum_{i=1}^A\vec{r}_i^2 =
 \frac{1}{A}\left[A^2\vec{R}^2+\sum_{i < j}(\vec{r}_i-\vec{r}_j)^2\right].
 \]
!et
 If we then introduce the harmonic oscillator one-body Hamiltonian
!bt 
\[
      H_0= \sum_{i=1}^A\left(\frac{\vec{p}_i^2}{2m}+
	   \frac{1}{2}m\omega^2\vec{r}_i^2\right),
 \]
!et
 with $\omega$ the oscillator frequency,
 we can rewrite the latter as 
!bt
 \[
      H_{\mathrm{HO}}= \frac{\vec{P}^2}{2mA}+\frac{mA\omega^2\vec{R}^2}{2}
	    +\frac{1}{2mA}\sum_{i < j}(\vec{p}_i-\vec{p}_j)^2
	    +\frac{m\omega^2}{2A}\sum_{i < j}(\vec{r}_i-\vec{r}_j)^2.
     label{eq:obho}
 \]
!et
 Or we could write 
!bt 
\[
 H_{\mathrm{HO}}= H_{\mathrm{CoM}}+\frac{1}{2mA}\sum_{i < j}(\vec{p}_i-\vec{p}_j)^2
	    +\frac{m\omega^2}{2A}\sum_{i < j}(\vec{r}_i-\vec{r}_j)^2,
 \]
!et
 with
!bt 
 \[
      H_{\mathrm{CoM}}= \frac{\vec{P}^2}{2mA}+\frac{mA\omega^2\vec{R}^2}{2}.

===== Translationally Invariant Hamiltonian  =====

 The translationally invariant one- and two-body  Hamiltonian reads for an A-nucleon system,
!bt
 \[

\hat{H}=\left[\sum_{i=1}^A\frac{\vec{p}_i^2}{2m} -\frac{\vec{P}^2}{2mA}\right] +\sum_{i < j}^A V_{ij} \; ,
 \]
!et
 where $V_{ij}$ is the nucleon-nucleon interaction. Adding zero as here
!bt 
\[
 \sum_{i=1}^A\frac{1}{2}m\omega^2\vec{r}_i^2-
 \frac{m\omega^2}{2A}\left[\vec{R}^2+\sum_{i < j}(\vec{r}_i-\vec{r}_j)^2\right]=0.
 \]
!et
we can then rewrite the Hamiltonian as 
!bt 
\[
 \hat{H}=\sum_{i=1}^A \left[ \frac{\vec{p}_i^2}{2m}
 +\frac{1}{2}m\omega^2 \vec{r}^2_i
 \right] + \sum_{i < j}^A \left[ V_{ij}-\frac{m\omega^2}{2A}
 (\vec{r}_i-\vec{r}_j)^2
 \right]-H_{\mathrm{CoM}}.

===== Single-particle Hamiltonians and spin-orbit force  =====
!bblock
We have introduced a single-particle Hamiltonian
!bt
\[
  H_0=\sum_{i=1}^A \hat{h}_0(x_i) =  \sum_{i=1}^A\left(\hat{t}(x_i) + \hat{u}_{\mathrm{ext}}(x_i)\right),
\]
!et
with an external and central symmetric potential $u_{\mathrm{ext}}(x_i)$, which is often 
approximated by a harmonic oscillator potential or a Woods-Saxon potential. Being central symmetric leads to a degeneracy 
in energy which is not observed experimentally. We see this from for example our discussion of separation energies and magic numbers. There are, in addition to the assumed magic numbers from a harmonic oscillator basis of $2,8,20,40,70\dots$ magic numbers like $28$, $50$, $82$ and $126$. 

To produce these additional numbers, we need to add a phenomenological spin-orbit force which lifts the degeneracy, that is
!bt
\[
\hat{h}(x_i) =  \hat{t}(x_i) + \hat{u}_{\mathrm{ext}}(x_i) +\xi(\bm{r})\bm{ls}=\hat{h}_0(x_i)+\xi(\bm{r})\bm{ls}. 
\]
!et
#            \includegraphics[scale=0.35]{graphics/singleparticle.png}

We have introduced a modified single-particle Hamiltonian
!bt
\[
\hat{h}(x_i) =  \hat{t}(x_i) + \hat{u}_{\mathrm{ext}}(x_i) +\xi(\bm{r})\bm{ls}=\hat{h}_0(x_i)+\xi(\bm{r})\bm{ls}. 
\]
!et
We can calculate the expectation value of the latter using the fact that
!bt
\[
\xi(\bm{r})\bm{ls}=\frac{1}{2}\xi(\bm{r})\left(\bm{j}^2-\bm{l}^2-\bm{s}^2\right).
\]
!et
For a single-particle state with quantum numbers $nlj$ (we suppress $s$ and $m_j$), with $s=1/2$, we obtain the single-particle energies
!bt
\[
\varepsilon_{nlj} = \varepsilon_{nlj}^{(0)}+\Delta\varepsilon_{nlj}, 
\]
!et
with $\varepsilon_{nlj}^{(0)}$ being the single-particle energy obtained with $\hat{h}_0(x)$ and
!bt 
\[
\Delta\varepsilon_{nlj}=\frac{C}{2}\left(j(j+1)-l(l+1)-\frac{3}{4}\right).
\]
!et
!eblock

!split
=====   Single-particle Hamiltonians and spin-orbit force  =====
!bblock
The spin-orbit force gives thus an additional contribution to the energy
!bt
\[
\Delta\varepsilon_{nlj}=\frac{C}{2}\left(j(j+1)-l(l+1)-\frac{3}{4}\right),
\]
!et
which lifts the degeneracy we have seen before in the harmonic oscillator or Woods-Saxon potentials. The value $C$ is the radial
integral involving $\xi(\bm{r})$. Depending on the value of $j=l\pm 1/2$, we obtain 
!bt
\[
\Delta\varepsilon_{nlj=l-1/2}=\frac{C}{2}l,
\]
!et
or
!bt
\[
\Delta\varepsilon_{nlj=l+1/2}=-\frac{C}{2}(l+1),
\]
!et
clearly lifting the degeneracy. Note well that till now we have simply postulated the spin-orbit force in *ad hoc* way.
Later, we will see how this term arises from the two-nucleon force in a natural way. 

With the spin-orbit force, we can modify our Woods-Saxon potential to 
!bt
\[
\hat{u}_{\mathrm{ext}}(r)=-\frac{V_0}{1+\exp{(r-R)/a}}+V_{so}(r)\bm{ls},
\]
!et
with
!bt 
\[
V_{so}(r) = V_{so}\frac{1}{r}\frac{d f_{so}(r)}{dr},
\]
!et
where we have 
!bt
\[
f_{so}(r) = \frac{1}{1+\exp{(r-R_{so})/a_{so}}}.
\]
!et
We can also add, in case of proton, a Coulomb potential. The Woods-Saxon potential has been widely used in parametrizations of
effective single-particle potentials. _However, as was the case with the harmonic oscillator, none of these potentials are linked directly to the nuclear forces_. Our next step is to build a mean field based on the nucleon-nucleon interaction.
This will lead us to our first and simplest many-body theory, Hartree-Fock theory.
