This quantity, to be discussed below, is defined as the difference between two binding energies (masses) of neighboring nuclei. As we will see from various figures below and exercises as well, the separation energies display a varying behavior as function of the number of neutrons or protons. These variations from one nucleus to another one, laid the foundation for the introduction of so-called magic numbers and a mean-field picture in order to describe nuclei theoretically.\n",

      "\n",
      "With a mean- or average-field picture we mean that a given nucleon (either a proton or a neutron) moves in an average potential field which is set up by all other nucleons in the system. Consider for example a nucleus like ${}^{17}\\mbox{O}$ with nine neutrons and eight protons. Many properties  of this nucleus can be interpreted in terms of a picture where we can view it as\n",
      "one neutron on top of ${}^{16}\\mbox{O}$. We infer from data and our theoretical interpretations that this additional neutron behaves almost as an individual neutron which *sees* an average interaction set up by the remaining 16 nucleons in   ${}^{16}\\mbox{O}$. A nucleus like ${}^{16}\\mbox{O}$ is an example of what we in this course will denote as a good closed-shell nucleus. We will come back to what this means later.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since we want to develop a theory capable of interpreting data in terms of our laws of motion and the pertinent forces,\n",
      "we can think of this neutron as a particle which moves in a potential field. We can hence attempt at solving our equations of motion (Schroedinger's equation in our case) for this system along the same lines as we did in atomic physics when we solved Schroedinger's equation for the hydrogen atom. We just need to define a model for our effective single-particle potential. \n",

      "A simple potential model which enjoys quite some popularity in nuclear physics, is the three-dimensional harmonic oscillator. This potential model captures some of the physics of deeply bound single-particle states but fails in reproducing \n",
      "the less bound single-particle states. A parametrized, and more realistic,  potential model which is widely used in nuclear physics, is the so-called Woods-Saxon potential. Both the harmonic oscillator and the Woods-Saxon potential models define computational problems that can easily be solved (see below), resulting (with the appropriate parameters) in a rather good reproduction of experiment for nuclei which can be approximated as one nucleon on top (or one nucleon removed) of a so-called closed-shell system.\n",

      "To be able to interpret a nucleus in such  a way requires at least that we are capable of parametrizing the abovementioned\n",
      "interactions in order to reproduce say the excitation spectrum of a nucleus like ${}^{17}\\mbox{O}$. \n",
      "\n",
      "With such a parametrized interaction we are able to solve Schroedinger's equation for the motion of one nucleon in a given field. A nucleus is however a true and complicated many-nucleon system, with extremely many degrees of freedom and complicated correlations, rendering the ideal solution of the many-nucleon Schroedinger equation an impossible enterprise. It is much easier to solve a single-particle problem with say a Woods-Saxon potential. Using such a potential hides however many of the complicated correlations and interactions which we see in nuclei. Such an effective single-nucleon potential is for example not capable of \n",
      "describing properties like the binding energy or the rms radius of a given nucleus. \n",
      "\n",
      "An improvement to these simpler single-nucleon potentials is given by the Hartree-Fock method, where the variational principle is used to define a mean-field which the nucleons move in. There are many different classes of mean-field methods.\n",
      "An important difference between these methods and the simpler parametrized mean-field potentials like the harmonic oscillator and the Woods-Saxon potentials, is that the resulting equations contain information about the nuclear forces present in our models for solving Schroedinger's equation. Hartree-Fock and other mean-field methods like density functional theory form core topics in later lectures.\n",

In particular, we will focus on separation and shell-gap energies and use these to build a picture of nuclei in terms of (from a philosophical stand we would call this  a reductionist approach) a single-particle picture. The harmonic oscillator will serve as an excellent starting point in building nuclei from the bottom and up. Here we will neglect nuclear forces, these are introduced in the next section when we discuss the Hartree-Fock method. \n",

      "**How our theoretical pictures and models can be used to interpret data is in essence what this course is about**. Our narrative will lead us along a path where we start with single-particle models and end with the theory of the nuclear shell-model. The latter will be used to understand and analyze excitation spectra and decay patterns of nuclei, linking our theoretical understanding with interpretations of experiment. The way we build up our theoretical descriptions and interpretations follows what we may call a standard reductionistic approach, that is we start with what we believe are our effective degrees of freedom (nucleons in our case) and interactions amongst these and solve thereafter the underlying equations of motions. This defines the nuclear many-body problem, and mean-field approaches like Hartree-Fock theory and the nuclear shell-model represent different approaches to our solutions of Schroedinger's equation.\n",
