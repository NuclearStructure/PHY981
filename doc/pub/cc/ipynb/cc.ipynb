    "can be formulated as an exponential of correlation\n",
    "operators $T$ acting on a reference state $\\mid\\Phi\\rangle$"

    "and applications have proven to be extremely useful, see for example the review by [Barrett and Musial](http://journals.aps.org/rmp/abstract/10.1103/RevModPhys.79.291) as well as the recent \n",

Many previous applications to nuclear physics struggled with the repulsive character of the nuclear forces and limited basis sets used in the computations. Most of these problems have been overcome during the last decade and coupled-cluster\n",
