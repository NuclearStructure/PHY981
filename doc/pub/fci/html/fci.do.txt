===== Slater determinants as basis states, Repetition =====
!bblock
The simplest possible choice for many-body wavefunctions are _product_ wavefunctions.
That is
!bt
\[ 
\Psi(x_1, x_2, x_3, \ldots, x_A) \approx \phi_1(x_1) \phi_2(x_2) \phi_3(x_3) \ldots
\]
!et
because we are really only good  at thinking about one particle at a time. Such 
product wavefunctions, without correlations, are easy to 
work with; for example, if the single-particle states $\phi_i(x)$ are orthonormal, then 
the product wavefunctions are easy to orthonormalize.   

Similarly, computing matrix elements of operators are relatively easy, because the 
integrals factorize.


The price we pay is the lack of correlations, which we must build up by using many, many product 
wavefunctions. (Thus we have a trade-off: compact representation of correlations but 
difficult integrals versus easy integrals but many states required.) 
!eblock

!split
===== Slater determinants as basis states, repetition =====
!bblock
Because we have fermions, we are required to have antisymmetric wavefunctions, e.g.
!bt
\[
\Psi(x_1, x_2, x_3, \ldots, x_A) = - \Psi(x_2, x_1, x_3, \ldots, x_A)
\]
!et
etc. This is accomplished formally by using the determinantal formalism
!bt
\[
\Psi(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_A) 
= \frac{1}{\sqrt{A!}} 
\det \left | 
\begin{array}{cccc}
\phi_1(x_1) & \phi_1(x_2) & \ldots & \phi_1(x_A) \\
\phi_2(x_1) & \phi_2(x_2) & \ldots & \phi_2(x_A) \\
 \vdots & & &  \\
\phi_A(x_1) & \phi_A(x_2) & \ldots & \phi_A(x_A) 
\end{array}
\right |
\]
!et
Product wavefunction + antisymmetry = Slater determinant.

!bt
\[
\Psi(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_A) 
= \frac{1}{\sqrt{N!}} 
\det \left | 
\begin{array}{cccc}
\phi_1(x_1) & \phi_1(x_2) & \ldots & \phi_1(x_A) \\
\phi_2(x_1) & \phi_2(x_2) & \ldots & \phi_2(x_A) \\
 \vdots & & &  \\
\phi_A(x_1) & \phi_A(x_2) & \ldots & \phi_A(x_A) 
\end{array}
\right |
\]

Properties of the determinant (interchange of any two rows or 
any two columns yields a change in sign; thus no two rows and no 
two columns can be the same) lead to the Pauli principle:

* No two particles can be at the same place (two columns the same); and
* No two particles can be in the same state (two rows the same).

===== Slater determinants as basis states =====
!bblock
As a practical matter, however, Slater determinants beyond $N=4$ quickly become 
unwieldy. Thus we turn to the _occupation representation_ or _second quantization_ to simplify calculations. 

The occupation representation, using fermion _creation_ and _annihilation_ 
operators, is compact and efficient. It is also abstract and, at first encounter, not easy to 
internalize. It is inspired by other operator formalism, such as the ladder operators for 
the harmonic oscillator or for angular momentum, but unlike those cases, the operators _do not have coordinate space representations_.

Instead, one can think of fermion creation/annihilation operators as a game of symbols that 
compactly reproduces what one would do, albeit clumsily, with full coordinate-space Slater 
determinants. 
!eblock

!split
===== Quick repetition of the occupation representation =====
!bblock
We start with a set of orthonormal single-particle states $\{ \phi_i(x) \}$. 
(Note: this requirement, and others, can be relaxed, but leads to a 
more involved formalism.) _Any_ orthonormal set will do. 

To each single-particle state $\phi_i(x)$ we associate a creation operator 
$\hat{a}^\dagger_i$ and an annihilation operator $\hat{a}_i$. 

When acting on the vacuum state $| 0 \rangle$, the creation operator $\hat{a}^\dagger_i$ causes 
a particle to occupy the single-particle state $\phi_i(x)$:
!bt
\[
\phi_i(x) \rightarrow \hat{a}^\dagger_i |0 \rangle
\]
!et
!eblock

!split
===== Quick repetition  of the occupation representation =====
!bblock
But with multiple creation operators we can occupy multiple states:
!bt
\[
\phi_i(x) \phi_j(x^\prime) \phi_k(x^{\prime \prime}) 
\rightarrow \hat{a}^\dagger_i \hat{a}^\dagger_j \hat{a}^\dagger_k |0 \rangle.
\]
!et

Now we impose antisymmetry, by having the fermion operators satisfy  _anticommutation relations_:
!bt
\[
\hat{a}^\dagger_i \hat{a}^\dagger_j + \hat{a}^\dagger_j \hat{a}^\dagger_i
= [ \hat{a}^\dagger_i ,\hat{a}^\dagger_j ]_+ 
= \{ \hat{a}^\dagger_i ,\hat{a}^\dagger_j \} = 0
\]
!et
so that 
!bt
\[
\hat{a}^\dagger_i \hat{a}^\dagger_j = - \hat{a}^\dagger_j \hat{a}^\dagger_i
\]
!et
!eblock


!split
===== Quick repetition  of the occupation representation =====
!bblock
Because of this property, automatically $\hat{a}^\dagger_i \hat{a}^\dagger_i = 0$, 
enforcing the Pauli exclusion principle.  Thus when writing a Slater determinant 
using creation operators, 
!bt
\[
\hat{a}^\dagger_i \hat{a}^\dagger_j \hat{a}^\dagger_k \ldots |0 \rangle
\]
!et
each index $i,j,k, \ldots$ must be unique.
!eblock


!split
===== Full Configuration Interaction Theory =====
!bblock
We have defined the ansatz for the ground state as 
!bt
\[
|\Phi_0\rangle = \left(\prod_{i\le F}\hat{a}_{i}^{\dagger}\right)|0\rangle,
\]
!et
where the index $i$ defines different single-particle states up to the Fermi level. We have assumed that we have $N$ fermions. 
A given one-particle-one-hole ($1p1h$) state can be written as
!bt
\[
|\Phi_i^a\rangle = \hat{a}_{a}^{\dagger}\hat{a}_i|\Phi_0\rangle,
\]
!et
while a $2p2h$ state can be written as
!bt
\[
|\Phi_{ij}^{ab}\rangle = \hat{a}_{a}^{\dagger}\hat{a}_{b}^{\dagger}\hat{a}_j\hat{a}_i|\Phi_0\rangle,
\]
!et
and a general $NpNh$ state as 
!bt
\[
|\Phi_{ijk\dots}^{abc\dots}\rangle = \hat{a}_{a}^{\dagger}\hat{a}_{b}^{\dagger}\hat{a}_{c}^{\dagger}\dots\hat{a}_k\hat{a}_j\hat{a}_i|\Phi_0\rangle.
\]
!et
!eblock

!split
===== Full Configuration Interaction Theory =====
!bblock
We can then expand our exact state function for the ground state 
as
!bt
\[
|\Psi_0\rangle=C_0|\Phi_0\rangle+\sum_{ai}C_i^a|\Phi_i^a\rangle+\sum_{abij}C_{ij}^{ab}|\Phi_{ij}^{ab}\rangle+\dots
=(C_0+\hat{C})|\Phi_0\rangle,
\]
!et
where we have introduced the so-called correlation operator 
!bt
\[
\hat{C}=\sum_{ai}C_i^a\hat{a}_{a}^{\dagger}\hat{a}_i  +\sum_{abij}C_{ij}^{ab}\hat{a}_{a}^{\dagger}\hat{a}_{b}^{\dagger}\hat{a}_j\hat{a}_i+\dots
\]
!et
Since the normalization of $\Psi_0$ is at our disposal and since $C_0$ is by hypothesis non-zero, we may arbitrarily set $C_0=1$ with 
corresponding proportional changes in all other coefficients. Using this so-called intermediate normalization we have
!bt
\[
\langle \Psi_0 | \Phi_0 \rangle = \langle \Phi_0 | \Phi_0 \rangle = 1, 
\]
!et
resulting in 
!bt
\[
|\Psi_0\rangle=(1+\hat{C})|\Phi_0\rangle.
\]
!et
!eblock

!split
===== Full Configuration Interaction Theory =====
!bblock
We rewrite 
!bt
\[
|\Psi_0\rangle=C_0|\Phi_0\rangle+\sum_{ai}C_i^a|\Phi_i^a\rangle+\sum_{abij}C_{ij}^{ab}|\Phi_{ij}^{ab}\rangle+\dots,
\]
!et
in a more compact form as 
!bt
\[
|\Psi_0\rangle=\sum_{PH}C_H^P\Phi_H^P=\left(\sum_{PH}C_H^P\hat{A}_H^P\right)|\Phi_0\rangle,
\]
!et
where $H$ stands for $0,1,\dots,n$ hole states and $P$ for $0,1,\dots,n$ particle states. 
Our requirement of unit normalization gives
!bt
\[
\langle \Psi_0 | \Phi_0 \rangle = \sum_{PH}|C_H^P|^2= 1,
\]
!et
and the energy can be written as 
!bt
\[
E= \langle \Psi_0 | \hat{H} |\Phi_0 \rangle= \sum_{PP'HH'}C_H^{*P}\langle \Phi_H^P | \hat{H} |\Phi_{H'}^{P'} \rangle C_{H'}^{P'}.
\]
!et
!eblock

!split
===== Full Configuration Interaction Theory =====
!bblock
Normally 
!bt
\[
E= \langle \Psi_0 | \hat{H} |\Phi_0 \rangle= \sum_{PP'HH'}C_H^{*P}\langle \Phi_H^P | \hat{H} |\Phi_{H'}^{P'} \rangle C_{H'}^{P'},
\]
!et
is solved by diagonalization setting up the Hamiltonian matrix defined by the basis of all possible Slater determinants. A diagonalization
# to do: add text about Rayleigh-Ritz
is equivalent to finding the variational minimum   of 
!bt
\[
 \langle \Psi_0 | \hat{H} |\Phi_0 \rangle-\lambda \langle \Psi_0 |\Phi_0 \rangle,
\]
!et
where $\lambda$ is a variational multiplier to be identified with the energy of the system.
The minimization process results in 
!bt
\[
\delta\left[ \langle \Psi_0 | \hat{H} |\Phi_0 \rangle-\lambda \langle \Psi_0 |\Phi_0 \rangle\right]=
\]
!et
!bt
\[
\sum_{P'H'}\left\{\delta[C_H^{*P}]\langle \Phi_H^P | \hat{H} |\Phi_{H'}^{P'} \rangle C_{H'}^{P'}+
C_H^{*P}\langle \Phi_H^P | \hat{H} |\Phi_{H'}^{P'} \rangle \delta[C_{H'}^{P'}]-
\lambda( \delta[C_H^{*P}]C_{H'}^{P'}+C_H^{*P}\delta[C_{H'}^{P'}]\right\} = 0.
\]
!et
Since the coefficients $\delta[C_H^{*P}]$ and $\delta[C_{H'}^{P'}]$ are complex conjugates it is necessary and sufficient to require the quantities that multiply with $\delta[C_H^{*P}]$ to vanish.  

This leads to 
!bt
\[
\sum_{P'H'}\langle \Phi_H^P | \hat{H} |\Phi_{H'}^{P'} \rangle C_{H'}^{P'}-\lambda C_H^{P}=0,
\]
!et
for all sets of $P$ and $H$.

If we then multiply by the corresponding $C_H^{*P}$ and sum over $PH$ we obtain
!bt
\[ 
\sum_{PP'HH'}C_H^{*P}\langle \Phi_H^P | \hat{H} |\Phi_{H'}^{P'} \rangle C_{H'}^{P'}-\lambda\sum_{PH}|C_H^P|^2=0,
\]
!et
leading to the identification $\lambda = E$. This means that we have for all $PH$ sets
!bt
\begin{equation}
\sum_{P'H'}\langle \Phi_H^P | \hat{H} -E|\Phi_{H'}^{P'} \rangle = 0. label{eq:fullci}
\end{equation}
!et
!eblock

!split
===== Full Configuration Interaction Theory =====
!bblock
An alternative way to derive the last equation is to start from 
!bt
\[
(\hat{H} -E)|\Psi_0\rangle = (\hat{H} -E)\sum_{P'H'}C_{H'}^{P'}|\Phi_{H'}^{P'} \rangle=0, 
\]
!et
and if this equation is successively projected against all $\Phi_H^P$ in the expansion of $\Psi$, then the last equation on the previous slide
results.   As stated previously, one solves this equation normally by diagonalization. If we are able to solve this equation exactly (that is
numerically exactly) in a large Hilbert space (it will be truncated in terms of the number of single-particle states included in the definition
of Slater determinants), it can then serve as a benchmark for other many-body methods which approximate the correlation operator
$\hat{C}$.  
!eblock

!split
===== Full Configuration Interaction Theory =====
!bblock
For reasons to come (links with Coupled-Cluster theory and Many-Body perturbation theory), 
we will rewrite Eq.~( ref{eq:fullci}) as a set of coupled non-linear equations in terms of the unknown coefficients $C_H^P$. 

To see this, we look at the contributions arising from 
!bt
\[
\langle \Phi_H^P | = \langle \Phi_0|
\]
!et
in  Eq.~(ref{eq:fullci}), that is we multiply with $\langle \Phi_0 |$
from the left in 
!bt
\[
(\hat{H} -E)\sum_{P'H'}C_{H'}^{P'}|\Phi_{H'}^{P'} \rangle=0. 
\]
!et
If we assume that we have a two-body operator at most, Slater's rule gives then an equation for the 
correlation energy in terms of $C_i^a$ and $C_{ij}^{ab}$ only.  We get then
!bt
\[
\langle \Phi_0 | \hat{H} -E| \Phi_0\rangle + \sum_{ai}\langle \Phi_0 | \hat{H} -E|\Phi_{i}^{a} \rangle C_{i}^{a}+
\sum_{abij}\langle \Phi_0 | \hat{H} -E|\Phi_{ij}^{ab} \rangle C_{ij}^{ab}=0,
\]
!et
or 
!bt
\[
E-E_0 =\Delta E=\sum_{ai}\langle \Phi_0 | \hat{H}|\Phi_{i}^{a} \rangle C_{i}^{a}+
\sum_{abij}\langle \Phi_0 | \hat{H}|\Phi_{ij}^{ab} \rangle C_{ij}^{ab},
\]
!et
where the energy $E_0$ is the reference energy and $\Delta E$ defines the so-called correlation energy.
The single-particle basis functions  could be the results of a Hartree-Fock calculation or just the eigenstates of the non-interacting part of the Hamiltonian. 

In our chapter on Hartree-Fock calculations, 
we have already computed the matrix $\langle \Phi_0 | \hat{H}|\Phi_{i}^{a}\rangle $ and $\langle \Phi_0 | \hat{H}|\Phi_{ij}^{ab}\rangle$.  If we are using a Hartree-Fock basis, then the matrix elements
$\langle \Phi_0 | \hat{H}|\Phi_{i}^{a}\rangle $ and we are left with a correlation energy given by
!bt
\[
E-E_0 =\Delta E^{HF}=\sum_{abij}\langle \Phi_0 | \hat{H}|\Phi_{ij}^{ab} \rangle C_{ij}^{ab}. 
\]
!et
 
!eblock

!split
===== Full Configuration Interaction Theory =====
!bblock
Inserting the various matrix elements we can rewrite the previous equation as
!bt
\[
\Delta E=\sum_{ai}\langle i| \hat{f}|a \rangle C_{i}^{a}+
\sum_{abij}\langle ij | \hat{v}| ab \rangle C_{ij}^{ab}.
\]
!et
This equation determines the correlation energy but not the coefficients $C$. 
We need more equations. Our next step is to set up
!bt
\[
\langle \Phi_i^a | \hat{H} -E| \Phi_0\rangle + \sum_{bj}\langle \Phi_i^a | \hat{H} -E|\Phi_{j}^{b} \rangle C_{j}^{b}+
\sum_{bcjk}\langle \Phi_i^a | \hat{H} -E|\Phi_{jk}^{bc} \rangle C_{jk}^{bc}+
\sum_{bcdjkl}\langle \Phi_i^a | \hat{H} -E|\Phi_{jkl}^{bcd} \rangle C_{jkl}^{bcd}=0,
\]
!et
as this equation will allow us to find an expression for the coefficents $C_i^a$ since we can rewrite this equation as 
!bt
\[
\langle i | \hat{f}| a\rangle +\langle \Phi_i^a | \hat{H}|\Phi_{i}^{a} \rangle C_{i}^{a}+ \sum_{bj\ne ai}\langle \Phi_i^a | \hat{H}|\Phi_{j}^{b} \rangle C_{j}^{b}+
\sum_{bcjk}\langle \Phi_i^a | \hat{H}|\Phi_{jk}^{bc} \rangle C_{jk}^{bc}+
\sum_{bcdjkl}\langle \Phi_i^a | \hat{H}|\Phi_{jkl}^{bcd} \rangle C_{jkl}^{bcd}=0.
\]
!et
!eblock

!split
===== Full Configuration Interaction Theory =====
!bblock
We rewrite this equation as
!bt
\[
C_{i}^{a}=-(\langle \Phi_i^a | \hat{H}|\Phi_{i}^{a})^{-1}
\]
!et
!bt
\[
\times\left(\langle i | \hat{f}| a\rangle+ \sum_{bj\ne ai}\langle \Phi_i^a | \hat{H}|\Phi_{j}^{b} \rangle C_{j}^{b}+\sum_{bcjk}\langle \Phi_i^a | \hat{H}|\Phi_{jk}^{bc} \rangle C_{jk}^{bc}+
\sum_{bcdjkl}\langle \Phi_i^a | \hat{H}|\Phi_{jkl}^{bcd} \rangle C_{jkl}^{bcd}\right).
\]
!et
Since these equations are solved iteratively ( that is we can start with a guess for the coefficients $C_i^a$), it is common to start the  iteration 
by setting 
!bt
\[
 C_{i}^{a}=-\frac{\langle i | \hat{f}| a\rangle}{\langle \Phi_i^a | \hat{H}|\Phi_{i}^{a}\rangle},
\]
!et
and the denominator can be written as
!bt
\[
  C_{i}^{a}=\frac{\langle i | \hat{f}| a\rangle}{\langle i | \hat{f}| i\rangle-\langle a | \hat{f}| a\rangle+\langle ai | \hat{v}| ai\rangle}.
\]
!et
The observant reader will however see that we need an equation for $C_{jk}^{bc}$ and $C_{jkl}^{bcd}$ as well.
To find equations for these coefficients we need then to continue our multiplications from the left with the various
$\Phi_{H}^P$ terms. 


!eblock

!split
===== Full Configuration Interaction Theory =====
!bblock
For $C_{jk}^{bc}$ we need then
!bt
\[
\langle \Phi_{ij}^{ab} | \hat{H} -E| \Phi_0\rangle + \sum_{kc}\langle \Phi_{ij}^{ab} | \hat{H} -E|\Phi_{k}^{c} \rangle C_{k}^{c}+
\]
!et
!bt
\[
\sum_{cdkl}\langle \Phi_{ij}^{ab} | \hat{H} -E|\Phi_{kl}^{cd} \rangle C_{kl}^{cd}+\sum_{cdeklm}\langle \Phi_{ij}^{ab} | \hat{H} -E|\Phi_{klm}^{cde} \rangle C_{klm}^{cde}+\sum_{cdefklmn}\langle \Phi_{ij}^{ab} | \hat{H} -E|\Phi_{klmn}^{cdef} \rangle C_{klmn}^{cdef}=0,
\]
!et
and we can isolate the coefficients $C_{kl}^{cd}$ in a similar way as we did for the coefficients $C_{i}^{a}$. 
At the end we can rewrite our solution of the Schr\"odinger equation in terms of $n$ coupled equations for the coefficients $C_H^P$.
This is a very cumbersome way of solving the equation. However, by using this iterative scheme we can illustrate how we can compute the
various terms in the wave operator or correlation operator $\hat{C}$. We will later identify the calculation of the various terms $C_H^P$
as parts of different many-body approximations to full CI. In particular, ww can  relate this non-linear scheme with Coupled Cluster theory and
many-body perturbation theory. These theories will not be discussed in this course.

===== Building a many-body basis =====
!bblock

In project 1 the plan  is to construct a working code that constructs the 
many-body Hamiltonian matrix in a basis of Slater determinants and to find the low-lying eigenenergies. 
This is referred to as the configuration-interaction method or shell-model diagonalization 
(or the interacting shell model). 

The first step in such codes--and in your project--is to construct the many-body basis.  

While the formalism is independent of the choice of basis, the _effectiveness_ of a calculation 
will certainly be basis dependent. 

Furthermore there are common conventions useful to know.
!eblock

===== Building a many-body basis =====
!bblock
First, the single-particle basis has angular momentum as a good quantum number.  You can 
imagine the single-particle wavefunctions being generated by a one-body Hamiltonian, 
for example a harmonic oscillator.  Modifications include harmonic oscillator plus 
spin-orbit splitting, or self-consistent mean-field potentials, or the Woods-Saxon potential which mocks 
up the self-consistent mean-field. 


For nuclei, the harmonic oscillator, modified by spin-orbit splitting, provides a useful language 
for describing single-particle states.


Each single-particle state is labeled by the following quantum numbers: 

* Orbital angular momentum $l$

* Intrinsic spin $s$ = 1/2 for protons and neutrons

* Angular momentum $j = l \pm 1/2$

* $z$-component $j_z$ (or $m$)

* Some labeling of the radial wavefunction, typically $n$ the number of nodes in  the radial wavefunction, but in the case of harmonic oscillator one can also use the principal quantum number $N$, where the harmonic oscillator energy is $(N+3/2)\hbar \omega$. 
!eblock


!split
===== Building a many-body basis =====
!bblock
In this format one labels states by $n(l)_j$, with $(l)$ replaced by a letter:
$s$ for $l=0$, $p$ for $l=1$, $d$ for $l=2$, $f$ for $l=3$, and thenceforth alphabetical.


 In practice the single-particle space has to be severely truncated.  This truncation is 
typically based upon the single-particle energies, which is the effective energy 
from a mean-field potential. 

Sometimes we freeze the core and only consider a valence space. For example, one 
may assume a frozen ${}^{4}\mbox{He}$ core, with two protons and two neutrons in the $0s_{1/2}$ 
shell, and then only allow active particles in the $0p_{1/2}$ and $0p_{3/2}$ orbits. 
!eblock

!split
===== Building a many-body basis =====
!bblock

Another example is a frozen ${}^{16}\mbox{O}$ core, with eight protons and eight neutrons filling the 
$0s_{1/2}$,  $0p_{1/2}$ and $0p_{3/2}$ orbits, with valence particles in the 
$0d_{5/2}, 1s_{1/2}$ and $0d_{3/2}$ orbits.


Sometimes we refer to nuclei by the valence space where their last nucleons go.  
So, for example, we call ${}^{12}\mbox{C}$ a $p$-shell nucleus, while ${}^{26}\mbox{Al}$ is an 
$sd$-shell nucleus and ${}^{56}\mbox{Fe}$ is a $pf$-shell nucleus.
!eblock

===== Building a many-body basis =====
!bblock
There are different kinds of truncations.

* For example, one can start with `filled' orbits (almost always the lowest), and then  allow one, two, three... particles excited out of those filled orbits. These are called  1p-1h, 2p-2h, 3p-3h excitations. 

* Alternately, one can state a maximal orbit and allow all possible configurations with  particles occupying states up to that maximum. This is called *full configuration*.

* Finally, for particular use in nuclear physics, there is the *energy* truncation, also  called the $N\hbar\Omega$ or $N_{max}$ truncation. 
!eblock

===== Building a many-body basis =====
!bblock
 Here one works in a harmonic oscillator basis, with each major oscillator shell assigned 
a principal quantum number $N=0,1,2,3,...$. 

The $N\hbar\Omega$ or $N_{max}$ truncation: Any configuration is given an noninteracting energy, which is the sum 
of the single-particle harmonic oscillator energies. (Thus this ignores 
spin-orbit splitting.)
!eblock


!split
===== Building a many-body basis =====
!bblock
Excited state are labeled relative to the lowest configuration by the 
number of harmonic oscillator quanta.

This truncation is useful because: if one includes *all* configuration up to 
some $N_{max}$, and has a translationally invariant interaction, then the intrinsic 
motion and the center-of-mass motion factor. In other words, we can know exactly 
the center-of-mass wavefunction. 
!eblock





!split
===== Building a many-body basis =====
!bblock
In almost all cases, the many-body Hamiltonian is rotationally invariant. This means 
it commutes with the operators $\hat{J}^2, \hat{J}_z$ and so eigenstates will have 
good $J,M$. Furthermore, the eigenenergies do not depend upon the orientation $M$. 


Therefore we can choose to construct a many-body basis which has fixed $M$; this is 
called an $M$-scheme basis. 


Alternately, one can construct a many-body basis which has fixed $J$, or a $J$-scheme 
basis. 

The Hamiltonian matrix will have smaller dimensions (a factor of 10 or more)
 in the $J$-scheme than in the $M$-scheme. 
On the other hand, as we'll show in the next slide, the $M$-scheme is very easy to 
construct with Slater determinants, while the $J$-scheme basis states, and thus the 
matrix elements, are more complicated, almost always being linear combinations of 
$M$-scheme states. $J$-scheme bases are important and useful, but we'll focus on the 
simpler $M$-scheme.

The quantum number $m$ is additive (because the underlying group is Abelian):

is built from single-particle states all with good $m$, then the total 
!bt
\[
M = m_i + m_j + m_k + \ldots
\]
!et
This is *not* true of $J$, because the angular momentum group SU(2) is not Abelian.

The upshot is that 
* It is easy to construct a Slater determinant with good total $M$;

* It is trivial to calculate $M$ for each Slater determinant;

* So it is easy to construct an $M$-scheme basis with fixed total $M$.

Note that the individual $M$-scheme basis states will *not*, in general, 
have good total $J$. 
Because the Hamiltonian is rotationally invariant, however, the eigenstates will 
have good $J$. (The situation is muddied when one has states of different $J$ that are 
nonetheless degenerate.)

The basic goal of the project is for you to build your own configuration-interaction  shell-model 
code. The code will be fairly basic; it will assume that we have 
a single species of particles, e.g. only neutrons, 
and you could, if you wish to,  read in uncoupled two-body matrix elements.  Furthermore the pieces of the code will not 
be the most efficient.  Nonetheless it will be usable; most importantly, you will gain a good idea of what goes into a many-body shell-model code.
!eblock



!split
===== Project, step 1 =====
!bblock

The first step  is to construct the $M$-scheme basis of Slater determinants.
Here $M$-scheme means the total $J_z$ of the many-body states is fixed.

The steps could be:

* Read in a user-supplied file of single-particle states (examples can be given) or just code these internally;

* Ask for the total $M$ of the system and the number of particles $N$;

* Construct all the $N$-particle states with given $M$.  You will validate the code by  comparing both the number of states and specific states.

|----------------------------------------------|

This represents the $1s_{1/2}0d_{3/2}0d_{5/2}$ valence space, or just the $sd$-space.  There are 
twelve single-particle states, labeled by an overall index, and which have associated quantum 
numbers the number of radial nodes, the orbital angular momentum $l$, and the 
angular momentum $j$ and third component $j_z$.  To keep everything as integers, we could store $2 \times j$ and 
$2 \times j_z$. 
!eblock

!split
===== Project, step 1 =====
!bblock
To read in the single-particle states you need to:
* Open the file 

*  Read the number of single-particle states (in the above example, 12);  allocate memory; all you need is a single array storing $2\times j_z$ for each state, labeled by the index.

* Read in the quantum numbers and store $2 \times j_z$ (and anything else you happen to want).
!eblock

!split
===== Project, step 1 =====
!bblock

The next step is to read in the number of particles $N$ and the fixed total $M$ (or, actually, $2 \times M$). 
For this project we assume only a single species of particles, say neutrons, although this can be 
relaxed. _Note_: Although it is often a good idea to try to write a more general code, given the 
short time alloted we would suggest you keep your ambition in check, at least in the initial phases of the 
project.  


You should probably write an error trap to make sure $N$ and $M$ are congruent; if $N$ is even, then 
$2 \times M$ should be even, and if $N$ is odd then $2\times M$ should be odd. 
!eblock

!split
===== Project, step 1 =====
!bblock
The final step is to generate the set of $N$-particle Slater determinants with fixed $M$. 
The Slater determinants will be stored in occupation representation.  Although in many codes
this representation is done compactly in bit notation with ones and zeros, but for 
greater transparency and simplicity we will list the occupied single particle states.

 Hence we can 
store the Slater determinant basis states as $sd(i,j)$, that is an 
array of dimension $N_{SD}$, the number of Slater determinants, by $N$, the number of occupied 
state. So if for the 7th Slater determinant the 2nd, 3rd, and 9th single-particle states are occupied, 
then $sd(7,1) = 2$, $sd(7,2) = 3$, and $sd(7,3) = 9$.
!eblock

!split
===== Project , step 1 =====
!bblock

We can construct an occupation representation of Slater determinants by the *odometer*
method.  Consider $N_{sp} = 12$ and $N=4$. 
Start with the first 4 states occupied, that is:

* $sd(1,:)= 1,2,3,4$ (also written as $|1,2,3,4 \rangle$)
Now increase the last occupancy recursively:
* $sd(2,:)= 1,2,3,5$
* $sd(3,:)= 1,2,3,6$
* $sd(4,:)= 1,2,3,7$
* $\ldots$
* $sd(9,:)= 1,2,3,12$

Then start over with 
* $sd(10,:)= 1,2,4,5$
and again increase the rightmost digit

* $sd(11,:)= 1,2,4,6$
* $sd(12,:)= 1,2,4,7$
* $\ldots$
* $sd(17,:)= 1,2,4,12$

When we restrict ourselves to an $M$-scheme basis, we could choose two paths. 
The first is simplest (and simplest is often best, at 
least in the first draft of a code): generate all possible Slater determinants, 
and then extract from this initial list a list of those Slater determinants with a given 
$M$. (You will need to write a short function or routine that computes $M$ for any 
given occupation.)  


Alternately, and not too difficult, is to run the odometer routine twice: each time, as 
as a Slater determinant is calculated, compute $M$, but do not store the Slater determinants 
except the current one. You can then count up the number of Slater determinants with a 
chosen $M$.  Then allocated storage for the Slater determinants, and run the odometer 
algorithm again, this time storing Slater determinants with the desired $M$ (this can be 
done with a simple logical flag).

*Some example solutions*:  Let's begin with a simple case, the $0d_{5/2}$ space containing six single-particle states

| 6  |   0 |    2  |    5/2  |    5/2 |
|---------------------------------|

For two particles, there are a total of 15 states, which we list here with the total $M$:
* $| 1,2 \rangle$, $M= -4$,  $| 1,3 \rangle$, $M= -3$
* $| 1,4 \rangle$, $M= -2$, $| 1,5 \rangle$, $M= -1$

Also, 
for the $sd$-space given above, for $N=2$ there are 14 states with $M=0$, for $N=3$ there are 37

In the shell-model context we can interpret this as 4 $s_{1/2}$ levels, with $m = \pm 1/2$, we can also think of these are simple four pairs,  $\pm k, k = 1,2,3,4$. Later on we will 
assign single-particle energies,  depending on the radial quantum number $n$, that is, 
$\epsilon_k = |k| \delta$ so that they are equally spaced.

For application in the pairing model we can go further and consider only states with 
no ``broken pairs,'' that is, if $+k$ is filled (or $m = +1/2$, so is $-k$ ($m=-1/2$). 
If you want, you can write your code to accept only these, and obtain the following 
six states:

* $|           1,           2 ,          3         ,       4  \rangle , $

Hints for coding

* When debugging, print out intermediate values. It's almost impossible to debug a  code by looking at it--the code will almost always win a `staring contest.'

* Validate code with SIMPLE CASES. Validate early and often.   


The number one mistake is using a too complex a system to test. For example ,
if you are computing particles in a potential in a box, try removing the potential--you should get 
particles in a box. And start with one particle, then two, then three... Don't start with 
eight particles.

Our recommended occupation representation, e.g. $| 1,2,4,8 \rangle$, is 
easy to code, but numerically inefficient when one has hundreds of 
millions of Slater determinants.


In state-of-the-art shell-model codes, one generally uses bit 
representation, i.e. $|1101000100... \rangle$ where one stores 
the Slater determinant as a single (or a small number of) integer.


This is much more compact, but more intricate to code with considerable 
more overhead. There exist 
bit-manipulation functions. 
This is left as a challenge for those of you who would like to study this topic further for the final project to be presented for the oral examination.

We consider a space with $2\Omega$ single-particle states, with each 
state labeled by 
$k = 1, 2, 3, \Omega$ and $m = \pm 1/2$. The convention is that 
the state with $k>0$ has $m = + 1/2$ while $-k$ has $m = -1/2$.


The Hamiltonian we consider is 
!bt
\[
\hat{H} = -G \hat{P}_+ \hat{P}_-,
\]
!et
where
!bt
\[
\hat{P}_+ = \sum_{k > 0} \hat{a}^\dagger_k \hat{a}^\dagger_{-{k}}.
\]
!et
and $\hat{P}_- = ( \hat{P}_+)^\dagger$.

This problem can be solved using what is called the quasi-spin formalism to obtain the 
exact results. Thereafter we will try again using the explicit Slater determinant formalism.

One can show (and this is part of the project) that
!bt
\[
\left [ \hat{P}_+, \hat{P}_- \right ] = \sum_{k> 0} \left( \hat{a}^\dagger_k \hat{a}_k 
+ \hat{a}^\dagger_{-{k}} \hat{a}_{-{k}} - 1 \right) = \hat{N} - \Omega.
\]
!et
Now define 
!bt
\[
\hat{P}_z = \frac{1}{2} ( \hat{N} -\Omega).
\]
!et
Finally you can show
!bt
\[
\left [ \hat{P}_z , \hat{P}_\pm \right ] = \pm \hat{P}_\pm.
\]
!et
This means the operators $\hat{P}_\pm, \hat{P}_z$ form a so-called  $SU(2)$ algebra, and we can 
use all our insights about angular momentum, even though there is no actual 
angular momentum involved (this is similar to project 1).

So we rewrite the Hamiltonian to make this explicit:
!bt
\[
\hat{H} = -G \hat{P}_+ \hat{P}_- 
= -G \left( \hat{P}^2 - \hat{P}_z^2 + \hat{P}_z\right)
\]
!et

!eblock

===== Example case: pairing Hamiltonian =====
!bblock

Because of the SU(2) algebra, we know that the eigenvalues of 
$\hat{P}^2$ must be of the form $p(p+1)$, with $p$ either integer or half-integer, and the eigenvalues of $\hat{P}_z$ 
are $m_p$ with $p \geq | m_p|$, with $m_p$ also integer or half-integer. 


But because $\hat{P}_z = (1/2)(\hat{N}-\Omega)$, we know that for $N$ particles 
the value $m_p = (N-\Omega)/2$. Furthermore, the values of $m_p$ range from 
$-\Omega/2$ (for $N=0$) to $+\Omega/2$ (for $N=2\Omega$, with all states filled). 

We deduce the maximal $p = \Omega/2$ and for a given $n$ the 
values range of $p$ range from $|N-\Omega|/2$ to $\Omega/2$ in steps of 1 
(for an even number of particles) 


Following Racah we introduce the notation
$p = (\Omega - v)/2$
where $v = 0, 2, 4,..., \Omega - |N-\Omega|$ 
With this it is easy to deduce that the eigenvalues of the pairing Hamiltonian are
!bt
\[
-G(N-v)(2\Omega +2-N-v)/4
\]
!et
This also works for $N$ odd, with $v= 1,3,5, \dots$.

!bt
\[

\]
!et
Now let's work this out explicitly. The single particle degrees of freedom are defined as

|----------------------------------------|
|Index | $k$   | $m$                     |

| 1 | 1 | -1/2   |

| 6 | -3 | 1/2 |

 There are  $\left( \begin{array}{c}6 \\ 3 \end{array} \right) = 20$ three-particle states, but there 
are 9 states with $M = +1/2$, namely
$| 1,2,3 \rangle, |1,2,5\rangle, | 1,4,6 \rangle, | 2,3,4 \rangle, |2,3,6 \rangle, | 2,4,5 \rangle, | 2, 5, 6 \rangle, |3,4,6 \rangle, | 4,5,6 \rangle$.

\]
!et
From this we can determine that 
!bt
\[
\hat{P}_- | 1, 4, 6 \rangle = \hat{P}_- | 2, 3, 6 \rangle

In several of the expectation values we will meet when evaluating explicit matrix elements, we will have to deal with expectation values involving spherical harmonics.

Till now we have mainly been concerned with the coupling of two angular momenta $j_aj_b$to a final angular momentum $J$.
If we wish to describe a three-body state with a final angular momentum $J$, we need to couple three angular momenta, say 
the two momenta $j_a,j_b$ to a third one $j_c$. The coupling order is important and leads to a less trivial implementation of the 
Pauli principle. With three angular momenta there are obviously $3!$ ways by which we can combine the angular momenta. 
In $m$-scheme a three-body Slater determinant is represented as (say for the case of $^{19}$O, three neutrons outside the core of $^{16}$O),
!bt
\[
|^{19}\mathrm{O}\rangle =|(abc)M\rangle  = a^{\dagger}_aa^{\dagger}_ba^{\dagger}_c|^{16}\mathrm{O}\rangle=|\Phi^{abc}\rangle.
\]
!et
The Pauli principle is automagically implemented via the anti-commutation relations.

However, when we deal the same state in an angular momentum coupled basis, we need to be a little bit more careful. We can namely couple the states
as follows
!bt
\[
| ([j_a\rightarrow j_b]J_{ab}\rightarrow j_c) J\rangle= \sum_{m_am_bm_c}\langle j_am_aj_bm_b|J_{ab}M_{ab}\rangle \langle J_{ab}M_{ab}j_cm_c|JM\rangle|j_am_a\rangle\otimes |j_bm_b\rangle \otimes |j_cm_c\rangle \ , 
label{eq:fabc}
\]
!et
that is, we couple first $j_a$ to $j_b$ to yield an intermediate angular momentum $J_{ab}$, then to $j_c$ yielding the final angular momentum $J$.

!eblock

!split
===== Angular momentum algebra, Wigner-Eckart theorem =====
!bblock 
Now, nothing hinders us from recoupling this state by coupling $j_b$ to $j_c$, yielding an intermediate angular momentum $J_{bc}$ and then couple this angular momentum to $j_a$, resulting in the final angular momentum $J'$. 

That is, we can have 
!bt
\[
| (j_a\rightarrow [j_b\rightarrow j_c]J_{bc}) J\rangle = \sum_{m_a'm_b'm_c'}\langle j_bm_b'j_cm_c'|J_{bc}M_{bc}\rangle \langle j_am_a'J_{bc}M_{bc}|J'M'\rangle|\Phi^{abc}\rangle .
\]
!et
We will always assume that we work with orthornormal states, this means that when we compute the overlap betweem these two possible ways of coupling angular momenta, we get 
!bt
\begin{eqnarray}
\nonumber
\lefteqn{ \langle (j_a\rightarrow [j_b\rightarrow j_c]J_{bc}) J'M'| ([j_a\rightarrow j_b]J_{ab}\rightarrow j_c) JM\rangle = } \\

A specific coupling order has to be respected in the symbol, that is, the so-called triangular relations between three angular momenta needs to be respected, that is

Can you find the inverse relation?  
These relations can in turn be used to write out the fully anti-symmetrized three-body wave function in a $J$-scheme coupled basis.

Note that the two-body intermediate state is assumed to be antisymmetric but
not normalized, that is, the state which involves the quantum numbers 
$j_a$ and $j_b$. Assume that the intermediate 
two-body state is antisymmetric. With this coupling order, we can 
rewrite ( in a schematic way) the general three-particle Slater determinant as 
!bt
\[
\Phi(a,b,c) = {\cal A} | ([j_a\rightarrow j_b]J_{ab}\rightarrow j_c) J\rangle,

with an implicit sum over $J_{ab}$.  The antisymmetrization operator ${\cal A}$ is used here to indicate that we need to antisymmetrize the state. _Challenge_: Use the definition of the $6j$ symbol and find an explicit

We can also coupled together four angular momenta. Consider two four-body states, with single-particle angular momenta $j_a$, $j_b$, $j_c$ and $j_d$ we can have a state with final $J$

Moreover, $j_c$ couples with $j_d$ to given and intermediate angular momentum $J_{cd}$.  The two intermediate angular momenta $J_{ab}$ and $J_{cd}$
are in turn coupled to a final $J$.  These operations involved three Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. 

Alternatively, we could couple in the following order

Normally, we start we a nucleon-nucleon interaction fitted to reproduce scattering data.
It is common then to represent this interaction in terms relative momenta $k$, the center-of-mass momentum $K$
and various partial wave quantum numbers like the spin $S$, the total relative angular  momentum ${\cal J}$, isospin $T$ and relative orbital momentum $l$ and finally the corresponding center-of-mass $L$.  
We can then write the  free interaction matrix $V$ as
