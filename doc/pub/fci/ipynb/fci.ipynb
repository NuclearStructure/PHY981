If we wish to include single-particle states that reflect weakly bound systems, we need a much larger single-particle basis. We need thus approximative methods that sum specific correlations to infinite order. \n",
    "\n",
    "Popular methods are\n",
    "* Many-body perturbation theory (in essence a Taylor expansion)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Coupled cluster theory (coupled non-linear equations)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Green's function approaches (matrix inversion)\n",

    "Here we will discuss how we can set up a single-particle basis which we can use in the various parts of our projects, from the simple pairing model to infinite nuclear matter. We will use here the simple pairing model to illustrate in particular how to set up a single-particle basis. We will also use this do discuss standard FCI approaches like:\n",
    " 1. Standard shell-model basis in one or two major shells\n",
    "\n",

    "## Building a many-body basis\n",
    "An important step in an FCI code  is to construct the many-body basis.  \n",
    "\n",
    "While the formalism is independent of the choice of basis, the **effectiveness** of a calculation \n",
    "will certainly be basis dependent. \n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore there are common conventions useful to know.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, the single-particle basis has angular momentum as a good quantum number.  You can \n",
    "imagine the single-particle wavefunctions being generated by a one-body Hamiltonian, \n",
    "for example a harmonic oscillator.  Modifications include harmonic oscillator plus \n",
    "spin-orbit splitting, or self-consistent mean-field potentials, or the Woods-Saxon potential which mocks \n",
    "up the self-consistent mean-field. \n",
    "For nuclei, the harmonic oscillator, modified by spin-orbit splitting, provides a useful language \n",
    "for describing single-particle states.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Building a many-body basis\n",
    "Each single-particle state is labeled by the following quantum numbers: \n",
    "\n",
    "* Orbital angular momentum $l$\n",
    "\n",
    "* Intrinsic spin $s$ = 1/2 for protons and neutrons\n",
    "\n",
    "* Angular momentum $j = l \\pm 1/2$\n",
    "\n",
    "* $z$-component $j_z$ (or $m$)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Some labeling of the radial wavefunction, typically $n$ the number of nodes in  the radial wavefunction, but in the case of harmonic oscillator one can also use the principal quantum number $N$, where the harmonic oscillator energy is $(N+3/2)\\hbar \\omega$.  For our nuclear matter projects, you will need to change the quantum numbers to those relevant for calculations\n",
    "\n",
    "in three-dimensional cartesian basis, see the relevante [lectures](https://github.com/NuclearTalent/Course2ManyBodyMethods/blob/master/doc/pub/cc/pdf/Lectures1-2_TALENT_NuclearMatter_GH.pdf).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this format one labels states by $n(l)_j$, with $(l)$ replaced by a letter:\n",
    "$s$ for $l=0$, $p$ for $l=1$, $d$ for $l=2$, $f$ for $l=3$, and thenceforth alphabetical.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Building a many-body basis\n",
    " In practice the single-particle space has to be severely truncated.  This truncation is \n",
    "typically based upon the single-particle energies, which is the effective energy \n",
    "from a mean-field potential. \n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes we freeze the core and only consider a valence space. For example, one \n",
    "may assume a frozen ${}^{4}\\mbox{He}$ core, with two protons and two neutrons in the $0s_{1/2}$ \n",
    "shell, and then only allow active particles in the $0p_{1/2}$ and $0p_{3/2}$ orbits. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Another example is a frozen ${}^{16}\\mbox{O}$ core, with eight protons and eight neutrons filling the \n",
    "$0s_{1/2}$,  $0p_{1/2}$ and $0p_{3/2}$ orbits, with valence particles in the \n",
    "$0d_{5/2}, 1s_{1/2}$ and $0d_{3/2}$ orbits.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes we refer to nuclei by the valence space where their last nucleons go.  \n",
    "So, for example, we call ${}^{12}\\mbox{C}$ a $p$-shell nucleus, while ${}^{26}\\mbox{Al}$ is an \n",
    "$sd$-shell nucleus and ${}^{56}\\mbox{Fe}$ is a $pf$-shell nucleus.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Building a many-body basis\n",
    "\n",
    "There are different kinds of truncations.\n",
    "\n",
    "* For example, one can start with `filled' orbits (almost always the lowest), and then  allow one, two, three... particles excited out of those filled orbits. These are called  1p-1h, 2p-2h, 3p-3h excitations. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Alternately, one can state a maximal orbit and allow all possible configurations with  particles occupying states up to that maximum. This is called *full configuration*.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Finally, for particular use in nuclear physics, there is the *energy* truncation, also  called the $N\\hbar\\Omega$ or $N_{max}$ truncation. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Building a many-body basis\n",
    "Here one works in a harmonic oscillator basis, with each major oscillator shell assigned  a principal quantum number $N=0,1,2,3,...$. \n",
    "The $N\\hbar\\Omega$ or $N_{max}$ truncation: Any configuration is given an noninteracting energy, which is the sum \n",
    "of the single-particle harmonic oscillator energies. (Thus this ignores \n",
    "spin-orbit splitting.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Excited state are labeled relative to the lowest configuration by the \n",
    "number of harmonic oscillator quanta.\n",
    "\n",
    "This truncation is useful because if one includes *all* configuration up to \n",
    "some $N_{max}$, and has a translationally invariant interaction, then the intrinsic \n",
    "motion and the center-of-mass motion factor. In other words, we can know exactly \n",
    "the center-of-mass wavefunction. \n",
    "\n",
    "In almost all cases, the many-body Hamiltonian is rotationally invariant. This means \n",
    "it commutes with the operators $\\hat{J}^2, \\hat{J}_z$ and so eigenstates will have \n",
    "good $J,M$. Furthermore, the eigenenergies do not depend upon the orientation $M$. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore we can choose to construct a many-body basis which has fixed $M$; this is \n",
    "called an $M$-scheme basis. \n",

    "## Building a many-body basis\n",
    "The Hamiltonian matrix will have smaller dimensions (a factor of 10 or more) in the $J$-scheme than in the $M$-scheme. \n",
    "On the other hand, as we'll show in the next slide, the $M$-scheme is very easy to \n",
    "construct with Slater determinants, while the $J$-scheme basis states, and thus the \n",
    "matrix elements, are more complicated, almost always being linear combinations of \n",
