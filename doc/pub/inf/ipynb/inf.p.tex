\subsection{Studies of infinite matter}


% --- begin paragraph admon ---
\paragraph{}
Studies of infinite nuclear matter play an important role  in nuclear physics. The aim of this part of the lectures is to provide the necessary ingredients for perfoming studies of neutron star matter (or matter in $\beta$-equilibrium) and symmetric nuclear matter. We start however with the electron gas in two and three dimensions for both historical and pedagogical reasons. Since there are several benchmark calculations for the electron gas, this small detour will allow us to establish the necessary formalism. Thereafter we will study infinite nuclear matter 
\begin{itemize}
\item at the Hartree-Fock with realistic nuclear forces and

\item using many-body methods like coupled-cluster theory or in-medium SRG as discussed in our previous sections.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{The infinite electron gas}

% --- begin paragraph admon ---
\paragraph{}
The electron gas is perhaps the only realistic model of a 
system of many interacting particles that allows for a solution
of the Hartree-Fock equations on a closed form. Furthermore, to first order in the interaction, one can also
compute on a closed form the total energy and several other properties of a many-particle systems. 
The model gives a very good approximation to the properties of valence electrons in metals.
The assumptions are

\begin{itemize}
 \item System of electrons that is not influenced by external forces except by an attraction provided by a uniform background of ions. These ions give rise to a uniform background charge. The ions are stationary.

 \item The system as a whole is neutral.

 \item We assume we have $N_e$ electrons in a cubic box of length $L$ and volume $\Omega=L^3$. This volume contains also a uniform distribution of positive charge with density $N_ee/\Omega$. 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{The electron gas}

% --- begin paragraph admon ---
\paragraph{}
The homogeneous electron gas is one of the few examples of a system of many
interacting particles that allows for a solution of the mean-field
Hartree-Fock equations on a closed form.  To first order in the
electron-electron interaction, this applies to ground state properties
like the energy and its pertinent equation of state as well.  The
homogeneus electron gas is a system of electrons that is not
influenced by external forces except by an attraction provided by a
uniform background of ions. These ions give rise to a uniform
background charge.  The ions are stationary and the system as a whole
is neutral.
Irrespective of this simplicity, this system, in both two and
three-dimensions, has eluded a proper description of correlations in
terms of various first principle methods, except perhaps for quantum
Monte Carlo methods. In particular, the diffusion Monte Carlo
calculations of \href{{http://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.45.566}}{Ceperley} 
and \href{{http://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.39.5005}}{Ceperley and Tanatar} 
are presently still considered as the
best possible benchmarks for the two- and three-dimensional electron
gas.

\subsection{The electron gas}

% --- begin paragraph admon ---
\paragraph{}
The electron gas, in 
two or three dimensions is thus interesting as a test-bed for 
electron-electron correlations. The three-dimensional 
electron gas is particularly important as a cornerstone 
of the local-density approximation in density-functional 
theory. In the physical world, systems 
similar to the three-dimensional electron gas can be 
found in, for example, alkali metals and doped 
semiconductors. Two-dimensional electron fluids are 
observed on metal and liquid-helium surfaces, as well as 
at metal-oxide-semiconductor interfaces. However, the Coulomb 
interaction has an infinite range, and therefore 
long-range correlations play an essential role in the
electron gas.
% --- end paragraph admon ---




% !split
\subsection{The electron gas}

% --- begin paragraph admon ---
\paragraph{}
At low densities, the electrons become 
localized and form a lattice. This so-called Wigner 
crystallization is a direct consequence 
of the long-ranged repulsive interaction. At higher
densities, the electron gas is better described as a
liquid.
When using, for example, Monte Carlo methods the electron gas must be approximated 
by a finite system. The long-range Coulomb interaction 
in the electron gas causes additional finite-size effects  that are not
present in other infinite systems like nuclear matter or neutron star matter.
This poses additional challenges to many-body methods when applied 
to the electron gas.

\subsection{The infinite electron gas as a homogenous system}

% --- begin paragraph admon ---
\paragraph{}
This is a homogeneous system and the one-particle wave functions are given by plane wave functions normalized to a volume $\Omega$ 
for a box with length $L$ (the limit $L\rightarrow \infty$ is to be taken after we have computed various expectation values)
\[
\psi_{\mathbf{k}\sigma}(\mathbf{r})= \frac{1}{\sqrt{\Omega}}\exp{(i\mathbf{kr})}\xi_{\sigma}
\]
where $\mathbf{k}$ is the wave number and  $\xi_{\sigma}$ is a spin function for either spin up or down
\[ 
\xi_{\sigma=+1/2}=\left(\begin{array}{c} 1 \\ 0 \end{array}\right) \hspace{0.5cm}
\xi_{\sigma=-1/2}=\left(\begin{array}{c} 0 \\ 1 \end{array}\right).
\]
% --- end paragraph admon ---



% !split
\subsection{Periodic boundary conditions}

% --- begin paragraph admon ---
\paragraph{}

We assume that we have periodic boundary conditions which limit the allowed wave numbers to
\[
k_i=\frac{2\pi n_i}{L}\hspace{0.5cm} i=x,y,z \hspace{0.5cm} n_i=0,\pm 1,\pm 2, \dots
\]
We assume first that the electrons interact via a central, symmetric and translationally invariant
interaction  $V(r_{12})$ with
$r_{12}=|\mathbf{r}_1-\mathbf{r}_2|$.  The interaction is spin independent.

The total Hamiltonian consists then of kinetic and potential energy
\[
\hat{H} = \hat{T}+\hat{V}.
\]
The operator for the kinetic energy can be written as
\[
\hat{T}=\sum_{\mathbf{k}\sigma}\frac{\hbar^2k^2}{2m}a_{\mathbf{k}\sigma}^{\dagger}a_{\mathbf{k}\sigma}.
\]
% --- end paragraph admon ---



% !split
\subsection{Defining the Hamiltonian operator}

% --- begin paragraph admon ---
\paragraph{}
The Hamiltonian operator is given by
\[
\hat{H}=\hat{H}_{el}+\hat{H}_{b}+\hat{H}_{el-b},
\]
with the electronic part
\[
\hat{H}_{el}=\sum_{i=1}^N\frac{p_i^2}{2m}+\frac{e^2}{2}\sum_{i\ne j}\frac{e^{-\mu |\mathbf{r}_i-\mathbf{r}_j|}}{|\mathbf{r}_i-\mathbf{r}_j|},
\]
where we have introduced an explicit convergence factor
(the limit $\mu\rightarrow 0$ is performed after having calculated the various integrals).
Correspondingly, we have
\[
\hat{H}_{b}=\frac{e^2}{2}\int\int d\mathbf{r}d\mathbf{r}'\frac{n(\mathbf{r})n(\mathbf{r}')e^{-\mu |\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}'|}}{|\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}'|},
\]
which is the energy contribution from the positive background charge with density
$n(\mathbf{r})=N/\Omega$. Finally,
\[
\hat{H}_{el-b}=-\frac{e^2}{2}\sum_{i=1}^N\int d\mathbf{r}\frac{n(\mathbf{r})e^{-\mu |\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{x}_i|}}{|\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{x}_i|},
\]
is the interaction between the electrons and the positive background.

\subsection{Single-particle Hartree-Fock energy}

% --- begin paragraph admon ---
\paragraph{}
In the first exercise below we show that the Hartree-Fock energy can be written as 
\[
\varepsilon_{k}^{HF}=\frac{\hbar^{2}k^{2}}{2m_e}-\frac{e^{2}}
{\Omega^{2}}\sum_{k'\leq
k_{F}}\int d\mathbf{r}e^{i(\mathbf{k}'-\mathbf{k})\mathbf{r}}\int
d\mathbf{r'}\frac{e^{i(\mathbf{k}-\mathbf{k}')\mathbf{r}'}}
{\vert\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}'\vert}
\]
resulting in
\[
\varepsilon_{k}^{HF}=\frac{\hbar^{2}k^{2}}{2m_e}-\frac{e^{2}
k_{F}}{2\pi}
\left[
2+\frac{k_{F}^{2}-k^{2}}{kk_{F}}ln\left\vert\frac{k+k_{F}}
{k-k_{F}}\right\vert
\right]
\]
% --- end paragraph admon ---



% !split
\subsection{Single-particle Hartree-Fock energy in a more compact form}

% --- begin paragraph admon ---
\paragraph{}

The previous result can be rewritten in terms of the density
\[
n= \frac{k_F^3}{3\pi^2}=\frac{3}{4\pi r_s^3},
\]
where $n=N_e/\Omega$, $N_e$ being the number of electrons, and $r_s$ is the radius of a sphere which represents the volum per conducting electron.  
It can be convenient to use the Bohr radius $a_0=\hbar^2/e^2m_e$.
For most metals we have a relation $r_s/a_0\sim 2-6$.  The quantity $r_s$ is dimensionless.

% !split
\subsection{Total Hartree-Fock energy}

% --- begin paragraph admon ---
\paragraph{}

In the second exercise below  we find that
the total energy
$E_0/N_e=\langle\Phi_{0}|\hat{H}|\Phi_{0}\rangle/N_e$ for
for this system to first order in the interaction is given as 
\[
E_0/N_e=\frac{e^2}{2a_0}\left[\frac{2.21}{r_s^2}-\frac{0.916}{r_s}\right].
\]

\subsection{Exercises: Hartree-Fock single-particle solution for the electron gas}

% --- begin paragraph admon ---
\paragraph{Exercise 1.}
The electron gas model allows closed form solutions for quantities like the 
single-particle Hartree-Fock energy.  The latter quantity is given by the following expression
\[
\varepsilon_{k}^{HF}=\frac{\hbar^{2}k^{2}}{2m}-\frac{e^{2}}
{V^{2}}\sum_{k'\leq
k_{F}}\int d\mathbf{r}e^{i(\mathbf{k'}-\mathbf{k})\mathbf{r}}\int
d\mathbf{r}'\frac{e^{i(\mathbf{k}-\mathbf{k'})\mathbf{r}'}}
{\vert\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r'}\vert}
\]
Show first that
\[
\varepsilon_{k}^{HF}=\frac{\hbar^{2}k^{2}}{2m}-\frac{e^{2}
k_{F}}{2\pi}
\left[
2+\frac{k_{F}^{2}-k^{2}}{kk_{F}}ln\left\vert\frac{k+k_{F}}
{k-k_{F}}\right\vert
\right]
\]
(Hint: Introduce the convergence factor 
$e^{-\mu\vert\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}'\vert}$
in the potential and use  $\sum_{\mathbf{k}}\rightarrow
\frac{V}{(2\pi)^{3}}\int d\mathbf{k}$ )

Rewrite the above result as a function of the density
\[
n= \frac{k_F^3}{3\pi^2}=\frac{3}{4\pi r_s^3},
\]
where $n=N/V$, $N$ being the number of particles, and $r_s$ is the radius of a sphere which represents the volum per conducting electron.

\subsection{Exercises: Hartree-Fock single-particle solution for the electron gas}

% --- begin paragraph admon ---
\paragraph{Exercise 1.}
It can be convenient to use the Bohr radius $a_0=\hbar^2/e^2m$.
For most metals we have a relation $r_s/a_0\sim 2-6$.

Make a plot of the free electron energy and the Hartree-Fock energy and discuss the behavior around the Fermi surface. Extract also   the Hartree-Fock band width $\Delta\varepsilon^{HF}$ defined as
\[ 
\Delta\varepsilon^{HF}=\varepsilon_{k_{F}}^{HF}-
\varepsilon_{0}^{HF}.
\]
Compare this results with the corresponding one for a free electron and comment your results. How large is the contribution due to the exchange term in the Hartree-Fock equation?

\subsection{Exercises: Hartree-Fock single-particle solution for the electron gas}

% --- begin paragraph admon ---
\paragraph{Exercise 1.}

We will now define a quantity called the effective mass.
For $\vert\mathbf{k}\vert$ near $k_{F}$, we can Taylor expand the Hartree-Fock energy as  
\[
\varepsilon_{k}^{HF}=\varepsilon_{k_{F}}^{HF}+
\left(\frac{\partial\varepsilon_{k}^{HF}}{\partial k}\right)_{k_{F}}(k-k_{F})+\dots
\]
If we compare the latter with the corresponding expressiyon for the non-interacting system
\[
\varepsilon_{k}^{(0)}=\frac{\hbar^{2}k^{2}_{F}}{2m}+
\frac{\hbar^{2}k_{F}}{m}\left(k-k_{F}\right)+\dots ,
\]
we can define the so-called effective Hartree-Fock mass as
\[
m_{HF}^{*}\equiv\hbar^{2}k_{F}\left(
\frac{\partial\varepsilon_{k}^{HF}}
{\partial k}\right)_{k_{F}}^{-1}
\]
Compute $m_{HF}^{*}$ and comment your results.

\paragraph{Exercise 1.}
Show that the level density (the number of single-electron states per unit energy) can be written as
\[
n(\varepsilon)=\frac{Vk^{2}}{2\pi^{2}}\left(
\frac{\partial\varepsilon}{\partial k}\right)^{-1}
\]
Calculate $n(\varepsilon_{F}^{HF})$ and comment the results.

\subsection{Hartree-Fock ground state energy for the  electron gas in three dimensions}

% --- begin paragraph admon ---
\paragraph{Partial solution to exercise 1.}
We want to show that, given the Hartree-Fock equation for the electron gas
\[
\varepsilon_{k}^{HF}=\frac{\hbar^{2}k^{2}}{2m}-\frac{e^{2}}
{V^{2}}\sum_{p\leq
k_{F}}\int d\mathbf{r}\exp{(i(\mathbf{p}-\mathbf{k})\mathbf{r})}\int
d\mathbf{r}'\frac{\exp{(i(\mathbf{k}-\mathbf{p})\mathbf{r}'})}
{\vert\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r'}\vert}
\]
the single-particle energy can be written as
\[
\varepsilon_{k}^{HF}=\frac{\hbar^{2}k^{2}}{2m}-\frac{e^{2}
k_{F}}{2\pi}
\left[
2+\frac{k_{F}^{2}-k^{2}}{kk_{F}}ln\left\vert\frac{k+k_{F}}
{k-k_{F}}\right\vert
\right].
\]

\subsection{Hartree-Fock ground state energy for the  electron gas in three dimensions}

% --- begin paragraph admon ---
\paragraph{}

We introduce the convergence factor 
$e^{-\mu\vert\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}'\vert}$
in the potential and use  $\sum_{\mathbf{k}}\rightarrow
\frac{V}{(2\pi)^{3}}\int d\mathbf{k}$. We can then rewrite the integral as 
\begin{align}
\frac{e^{2}}
{V^{2}}\sum_{k'\leq
k_{F}}\int d\mathbf{r}\exp{(i(\mathbf{k'}-\mathbf{k})\mathbf{r})}\int
d\mathbf{r}'\frac{\exp{(i(\mathbf{k}-\mathbf{p})\mathbf{r}'})}
{\vert\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r'}\vert}= & \\
\frac{e^{2}}{V (2\pi)^3}  \int d\mathbf{r}\int
\frac{d\mathbf{r}'}{\vert\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r'}\vert}\exp{(-i\mathbf{k}(\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}'))}\int d\mathbf{p}\exp{(i\mathbf{p}(\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}'))},
\end{align}
and introducing the abovementioned convergence factor we have
\begin{align}
\lim_{\mu \to 0}\frac{e^{2}}{V (2\pi)^3}  \int d\mathbf{r}\int d\mathbf{r}'\frac{\exp{(-\mu\vert\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}'\vert})}{\vert\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r'}\vert}\int d\mathbf{p}\exp{(i(\mathbf{p}-\mathbf{k})(\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}'))}.
\end{align}
% --- end paragraph admon ---

\subsection{Hartree-Fock ground state energy for the  electron gas in three dimensions}

% --- begin paragraph admon ---
\paragraph{}
With a change variables to $\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}'$ and $\mathbf{y}=\mathbf{r}'$ we rewrite the last integral as
\[
\lim_{\mu \to 0}\frac{e^{2}}{V (2\pi)^3}  \int d\mathbf{p}\int d\mathbf{y}\int d\mathbf{x}\exp{(i(\mathbf{p}-\mathbf{k})\mathbf{x})}\frac{\exp{(-\mu\vert\mathbf{x}\vert})}{\vert\mathbf{x}\vert}.
\]
The integration over $\mathbf{x}$ can be performed using spherical coordinates, resulting in (with $x=\vert \mathbf{x}\vert$)
\[
\int d\mathbf{x}\exp{(i(\mathbf{p}-\mathbf{k})\mathbf{x})}\frac{\exp{(-\mu\vert\mathbf{x}\vert})}{\vert\mathbf{x}\vert}=\int x^2 dx d\phi d\cos{(\theta)}\exp{(i(\mathbf{p}-\mathbf{k})x\cos{(\theta))}}\frac{\exp{(-\mu x)}}{x}.

We obtain
\begin{align}
4\pi \int dx \frac{ \sin{(\vert \mathbf{p}-\mathbf{k}\vert)x} }{\vert \mathbf{p}-\mathbf{k}\vert}{\exp{(-\mu x)}}= \frac{4\pi}{\mu^2+\vert \mathbf{p}-\mathbf{k}\vert^2}.
\end{align}
This results gives us 
\begin{align}
\lim_{\mu \to 0}\frac{e^{2}}{V (2\pi)^3}  \int d\mathbf{p}\int d\mathbf{y}\frac{4\pi}{\mu^2+\vert \mathbf{p}-\mathbf{k}\vert^2}=\lim_{\mu \to 0}\frac{e^{2}}{ 2\pi^2}  \int d\mathbf{p}\frac{1}{\mu^2+\vert \mathbf{p}-\mathbf{k}\vert^2},

Introducing spherical coordinates we can rewrite the integral as

\frac{e^{2}}{\pi}  \int_0^{k_F} p^2dp\int_0^{\pi} d\theta\cos{(\theta)}\frac{1}{p^2+k^2-2pk\cos{(\theta)}},

and with the change of variables $\cos{(\theta)}=u$ we have 
\[
\frac{e^{2}}{\pi}  \int_0^{k_F} p^2dp\int_{0}^{\pi} d\theta\cos{(\theta)}\frac{1}{p^2+k^2-2pk\cos{(\theta)}}=\frac{e^{2}}{\pi}  \int_0^{k_F} p^2dp\int_{-1}^{1} du\frac{1}{p^2+k^2-2pku},

We can now define the so-called band gap, that is the scatter between the maximal and the minimal value of the electrons in the conductance band of a metal (up to the Fermi level). 
For $x=1$ and $r_s/a_0=4$ we have 
\[
\frac{\varepsilon_{k=k_F}^{HF} }{\varepsilon_{0}^{F}} = -0.326,
\]
and for $x=0$ we have
\[
\frac{\varepsilon_{k=0}^{HF} }{\varepsilon_{0}^{F}} = -2.652,

\[
\Delta \varepsilon^{HF} = \frac{\varepsilon_{k=k_F}^{HF} }{\varepsilon_{0}^{F}}-\frac{\varepsilon_{k=0}^{HF} }{\varepsilon_{0}^{F}} = 2.326.

This quantity measures the deviation from the $k=0$ single-particle energy and the energy at the Fermi level.

\paragraph{Exercise 2.}
We consider a system of electrons in infinite matter, the so-called electron gas. This is a homogeneous system and the one-particle states are given by plane wave function normalized to a volume $\Omega$ 
for a box with length $L$ (the limit $L\rightarrow \infty$ is to be taken after we have computed various expectation values)
\[
\psi_{\mathbf{k}\sigma}(\mathbf{r})= \frac{1}{\sqrt{\Omega}}\exp{(i\mathbf{kr})}\xi_{\sigma}
\]
where $\mathbf{k}$ is the wave number and  $\xi_{\sigma}$ is a spin function for either spin up or down
\[ 
\xi_{\sigma=+1/2}=\left(\begin{array}{c} 1 \\ 0 \end{array}\right) \hspace{0.5cm}
\xi_{\sigma=-1/2}=\left(\begin{array}{c} 0 \\ 1 \end{array}\right).
\]
We assume that we have periodic boundary conditions which limit the allowed wave numbers to
\[
k_i=\frac{2\pi n_i}{L}\hspace{0.5cm} i=x,y,z \hspace{0.5cm} n_i=0,\pm 1,\pm 2, \dots
\]
We assume first that the particles interact via a central, symmetric and translationally invariant
interaction  $V(r_{12})$ with
$r_{12}=|\mathbf{r}_1-\mathbf{r}_2|$.  The interaction is spin independent.

Let us now calculate the following part of the Hamiltonian
\[ \hat H_b = \frac{e^2}{2} \iint \frac{n(\mathbf{r}) n(\mathbf{r}')e^{-\mu|\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r}'|}}{|\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r}'|} d\mathbf{r} d\mathbf{r}' , 
\]
where $n(\mathbf{r}) = N_e/\Omega$, the density of the positive background charge. We define $\mathbf{r}_{12} = \mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r}'$, resulting in $d\mathbf{r}_{12} = d\mathbf{r}$, and allowing us to rewrite the integral as
\[ 
\hat H_b = \frac{e^2 N_e^2}{2\Omega^2} \iint \frac{e^{-\mu |\mathbf{r}_{12}|}}{|\mathbf{r}_{12}|} d\mathbf{r}_{12} d\mathbf{r}' = \frac{e^2 N_e^2}{2\Omega} \int \frac{e^{-\mu |\mathbf{r}_{12}|}}{|\mathbf{r}_{12}|} d\mathbf{r}_{12} . 
\]
Here we have used that $\int \! \mathbf{r} = \Omega$. We change to spherical coordinates and the lack of angle 
dependencies yields a factor $4\pi$, resulting in
\[ 
\hat H_b = \frac{4\pi e^2 N_e^2}{2\Omega} \int_0^\infty re^{-\mu r} \, \mathrm{d} r .

Solving by partial integration

= \frac{1}{\mu} \left[ - \frac{1}{\mu} e^{-\mu r} \right]_0^\infty = \frac{1}{\mu^2}, 
\]
gives
\[
\hat{H}_b = \frac{e^2}{2} \frac{N_e^2}{\Omega} \frac{4\pi}{\mu^2} .

The next term is 
\[ 
\hat H_{el-b} = -e^2 \sum_{i = 1}^N \int \frac{n(\mathbf{r}) e^{-\mu |\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{x}_i|}}{|\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{x}_i|} \mathbf{r} .

Inserting  $n(\mathbf{r})$ and changing variables in the same way as in the previous integral $\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{r} - \mathbf{x}_i$, we get $\mathrm{d}^3 \mathbf{y} = \mathrm{d}^3 \mathbf{r}$. This gives
\begin{align}
\hat H_{el-b} = -\frac{e^2 N_e}{\Omega} \sum_{i = 1^N} \int \frac{e^{-\mu |\mathbf{y}|}}{|\mathbf{y}|} \, \mathrm{d}^3 \mathbf{y}
=  -\frac{4\pi e^2 N_e}{\Omega} \sum_{i = 1}^N \int_0^\infty y e^{-\mu y} \mathrm{d} y. 
\end{align}
We have already seen this  type of integral. The answer is 
\[ 
\hat H_{el-b} = -\frac{4\pi e^2 N_e}{\Omega} \sum_{i = 1}^N \frac{1}{\mu^2}, 
\]
which gives

\hat H_{el-b} = -e^2 \frac{N_e^2}{\Omega} \frac{4\pi}{\mu^2} .

\]
The last term represents the repulsion between two electrons. It is a central symmetric interaction
and is translationally invariant. The potential is given by the expression
\[ 
v(|\mathbf{r}|) = e^2 \frac{e^{\mu|\mathbf{r}|}}{|\mathbf{r}|},

which we derived in connection with the single-particle Hartree-Fock derivation.

In the three-dimensional electron gas, the Ewald

  \frac{4\pi }{L^{3}k^{2}}e^{i\mathbf{k}\cdot \mathbf{r}}
  e^{-\eta^{2}k^{2}/4} \nonumber \\

    \mathbf{r}-\mathbf{R}\right|}{\eta }\right)
  - \frac{\pi \eta^{2}}{L^{3}},
\end{align}
where $L$ is the box side length, $\mathrm{erfc}(x)$ is the 
complementary error function, and $\eta $ is a free
parameter that can take any value in the interval 
$(0, \infty )$.

\subsection{Interaction in momentum space}

% --- begin paragraph admon ---
\paragraph{}
The translational vector 
\begin{align}
  \mathbf{R} = L\left(n_{x}\mathbf{u}_{x} + n_{y}
  \mathbf{u}_{y} + n_{z}\mathbf{u}_{z}\right) ,
\end{align}
where $\mathbf{u}_{i}$ is the unit vector for dimension $i$,
is defined for all integers $n_{x}$, $n_{y}$, and 
$n_{z}$. These vectors are used to obtain all image
cells in the entire real space. 
The parameter $\eta $ decides how 
the Coulomb interaction is divided into a short-ranged
and long-ranged part, and does not alter the total
function. However, the number of operations needed
to calculate the Ewald interaction with a desired 
accuracy depends on $\eta $, and $\eta $ is therefore 
often chosen to optimize the convergence as a function
of the simulation-cell size. In
our calculations, we choose $\eta $ to be an infinitesimally
small positive number, similarly as was done by \href{{https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.86.035111}}{Shepherd *et al.*} and \href{{https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.88.115138}}{Roggero *et al.*}.

This gives an interaction that is evaluated only in
Fourier space.

\paragraph{}
When studying the two-dimensional electron gas, we

The interaction is derived in three dimensions, with 
Fourier discretization in only two dimensions. The Ewald effective
interaction has the form 
\begin{align}
  v_{E}(\mathbf{r}) &= \sum_{\mathbf{k} \neq \mathbf{0}} 
  \frac{\pi }{L^{2}k}\left\{ e^{-kz} \mathrm{erfc} \left(
  \frac{\eta k}{2} - \frac{z}{\eta }\right)+ \right. \nonumber \\
  & \left. e^{kz}\mathrm{erfc} \left( \frac{\eta k}{2} + \frac{z}{\eta }
  \right) \right\} e^{i\mathbf{k}\cdot \mathbf{r}_{xy}} 
  \nonumber \\
  & + \sum_{\mathbf{R}}\frac{1}{\left| \mathbf{r}-\mathbf{R}
    \right| } \mathrm{erfc} \left( \frac{\left| \mathbf{r}-\mathbf{R}
    \right|}{\eta }\right) \nonumber \\
  & - \frac{2\pi}{L^{2}}\left\{ z\mathrm{erf} \left( \frac{z}{\eta }
  \right) + \frac{\eta }{\sqrt{\pi }}e^{-z^{2}/\eta^{2}}\right\},
\end{align}
where the Fourier vectors $\mathbf{k}$ and the position vector
$\mathbf{r}_{xy}$ are defined in the $(x,y)$ plane. When
applying the interaction $v_{E}(\mathbf{r})$ to two-dimensional
systems, we set $z$ to zero.

\subsection{And in three dimensions}

\paragraph{}
Similarly as in the 
three-dimensional case, also here we 
choose $\eta $ to approach zero from above. The resulting 
Fourier-transformed interaction is
\begin{align}
  v_{E}^{\eta = 0, z = 0}(\mathbf{r}) = \sum_{\mathbf{k} \neq \mathbf{0}} 
  \frac{2\pi }{L^{2}k}e^{i\mathbf{k}\cdot \mathbf{r}_{xy}}.

\subsection{Hartree-Fock benchmarks in two and three dimensions}

% --- begin paragraph admon ---
\paragraph{}
Finally, a useful benchmark for our calculations is the expression for
the reference energy $E_0$ per particle.
Defining the $T=0$ density $\rho_0$, we can in turn determine in three
dimensions the radius $r_0$ of a sphere representing the volume an
electron occupies (the classical electron radius) as
\[
r_0= \left(\frac{3}{4\pi \rho}\right)^{1/3}.
\]
In two dimensions the corresponding quantity is
\[
r_0= \left(\frac{1}{\pi \rho}\right)^{1/2}.
\]

\subsection{Hartree-Fock energies}

% --- begin paragraph admon ---
\paragraph{}
One can then express the reference energy per electron in terms of the
dimensionless quantity $r_s=r_0/a_0$, where we have introduced the
Bohr radius $a_0=\hbar^2/e^2m$. The energy per electron computed with
the reference Slater determinant can then be written as
(using hereafter only atomic units, meaning that $\hbar = m = e = 1$)
\[
E_0/N=\frac{1}{2}\left[\frac{2.21}{r_s^2}-\frac{0.916}{r_s}\right],
\]
for the three-dimensional electron gas.  For the two-dimensional gas
the corresponding expression is (show this)
\[
E_0/N=\frac{1}{r_s^2}-\frac{8\sqrt{2}}{3\pi r_s}.
\]

\subsection{Simplifications to many-body theories}

% --- begin paragraph admon ---
\paragraph{}
For an infinite homogeneous system, there are some particular
simplications due to the conservation of the total momentum of the
particles.  By symmetry considerations, the total momentum of the
system has to be zero. Both the kinetic energy operator and the
total Hamiltonian $\hat{H}$ are assumed to be diagonal in the total
momentum $\mathbf{K}$. Hence, both the reference state $\Phi_{0}$ and
the correlated ground state $\Psi$ must be eigenfunctions of the
operator $\mathbf{\hat{K}}$ with the corresponding eigenvalue
$\mathbf{K} = \mathbf{0}$.  This leads to important
simplications to our different many-body methods. In coupled cluster
theory for example, all
terms that involve single particle-hole excitations vanish.

\subsection{Specific tasks}

% --- begin paragraph admon ---
\paragraph{}

\begin{itemize}
\item Start by solving exercises 1 and 2 and convince yourself about the correctness of the expressions.

\item Convince yourself about the Hartree-Fock results for the two-dimensional system.

\item In order to start coding, you should read in parallel a text on \href{{http://www.uio.no/studier/emner/matnat/fys/FYS3150/h14/undervisningsmateriale/Lecture%20Notes/lecture2014.pdf}}{programming and numerical methods}.

\item The first programming exercise is to set up the basis functions for two and three dimensions using periodic boundary conditions. Extend the table above to the three-dimensional case. 

\item Compute thereafter the Hartree-Fock energy in two and three dimensions and make sure that your basis is large enough to reach the so-called Hartree-Fock limit.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Screened interactions and periodic boundary conditions}

% --- begin paragraph admon ---
\paragraph{}
As soon as you have the Hartree-Fock program functioning, you can start looking at a modified Coulomb interaction with a screening term, a so-called Yukawa-type interaction, that is 
\[
V(r) \approx \frac{\exp{-(\mu r)}}{\mu r},
\]
where $\mu$ plays the role of an effective range parameter with dimension inverse length. 
\begin{itemize}
\item Play around with different  values of $\mu$ and check the stability of the Hartree-Fock results as function of the number of single-particle basis states. 

\item Study thereafter the stability of the solutions (pick some selected values of $\mu$ and study the Hartree-Fock results with standard periodic boundary conditions and so-called \href{{https://journals.aps.org/prc/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevC.89.014319}}{twisted boundary conditions}.
