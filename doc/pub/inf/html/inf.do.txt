===== Electron gas and HF solution =====
!bblock
The electron gas is perhaps the only realistic model of a 
system of many interacting particles that allows for a solution
of the Hartree-Fock equations on a closed form. Furthermore, to first order in the interaction, one can also
compute on a closed form the total energy and several other properties of a many-particle systems. 
The model gives a very good approximation to the properties of valence electrons in metals.
The assumptions are

*  System of electrons that is not influenced by external forces except by an attraction provided by a uniform background of ions. These ions give rise to a uniform background charge. The ions are stationary.
*  The system as a whole is neutral.
*  We assume we have $N_e$ electrons in a cubic box of length $L$ and volume $\Omega=L^3$. This volume contains also a
uniform distribution of positive charge with density $N_ee/\Omega$. 


This is a homogeneous system and the one-particle wave functions are given by plane wave functions normalized to a volume $\Omega$ 
for a box with length $L$ (the limit $L\rightarrow \infty$ is to be taken after we have computed various expectation values)
!bt
\[
\psi_{{\bf k}\sigma}({\bf r})= \frac{1}{\sqrt{\Omega}}\exp{(i{\bf kr})}\xi_{\sigma}
\]
!et
where ${\bf k}$ is the wave number and  $\xi_{\sigma}$ is a spin function for either spin up or down
!bt
\[ 
\xi_{\sigma=+1/2}=\left(\begin{array}{c} 1 \\ 0 \end{array}\right) \hspace{0.5cm}
\xi_{\sigma=-1/2}=\left(\begin{array}{c} 0 \\ 1 \end{array}\right).
\]
!et
We assume that we have periodic boundary conditions which limit the allowed wave numbers to
!bt
\[
k_i=\frac{2\pi n_i}{L}\hspace{0.5cm} i=x,y,z \hspace{0.5cm} n_i=0,\pm 1,\pm 2, \dots
\]
!et
We assume first that the electrons interact via a central, symmetric and translationally invariant
interaction  $V(r_{12})$ with
$r_{12}=|{\bf r}_1-{\bf r}_2|$.  The interaction is spin independent.

The total Hamiltonian consists then of kinetic and potential energy
!bt
\[
\hat{H} = \hat{T}+\hat{V}.
\]
!et
The operator for the kinetic energy can be written as
!bt
\[
\hat{T}=\sum_{{\bf k}\sigma}\frac{\hbar^2k^2}{2m}a_{{\bf k}\sigma}^{\dagger}a_{{\bf k}\sigma}.
\]
!et

The Hamilton operator is given by
!bt
\[
\hat{H}=\hat{H}_{el}+\hat{H}_{b}+\hat{H}_{el-b},
\]
!et
with the electronic part
!bt
\[
\hat{H}_{el}=\sum_{i=1}^N\frac{p_i^2}{2m}+\frac{e^2}{2}\sum_{i\ne j}\frac{e^{-\mu |{\bf r}_i-{\bf r}_j|}}{|{\bf r}_i-{\bf r}_j|},
\]
!et
where we have introduced an explicit convergence factor
(the limit $\mu\rightarrow 0$ is performed after having calculated the various integrals).
Correspondingly, we have
!bt
\[
\hat{H}_{b}=\frac{e^2}{2}\int\int d{\bf r}d{\bf r}'\frac{n({\bf r})n({\bf r}')e^{-\mu |{\bf r}-{\bf r}'|}}{|{\bf r}-{\bf r}'|},
\]
!et
which is the energy contribution from the positive background charge with density
$n({\bf r})=N/\Omega$. Finally,
!bt
\[
\hat{H}_{el-b}=-\frac{e^2}{2}\sum_{i=1}^N\int d{\bf r}\frac{n({\bf r})e^{-\mu |{\bf r}-{\bf x}_i|}}{|{\bf r}-{\bf x}_i|},
\]
!et
is the interaction between the electrons and the positive background.

In exercise 5 we show that the Hartree-Fock energy can be written as 
!bt
\[
\varepsilon_{k}^{HF}=\frac{\hbar^{2}k^{2}}{2m_e}-\frac{e^{2}}
{\Omega^{2}}\sum_{k'\leq
k_{F}}\int d{\bf r}e^{i({\bf k}'-{\bf k}){\bf r}}\int
d{\bf r'}\frac{e^{i({\bf k}-{\bf k}'){\bf r}'}}
{\vert{\bf r}-{\bf r}'\vert}
\]
!et
resulting in
!bt
\[
\varepsilon_{k}^{HF}=\frac{\hbar^{2}k^{2}}{2m_e}-\frac{e^{2}
k_{F}}{2\pi}
\left[
2+\frac{k_{F}^{2}-k^{2}}{kk_{F}}ln\left\vert\frac{k+k_{F}}
{k-k_{F}}\right\vert
\right]
\]
!et

The results can be rewritten in terms of the density
!bt
\[
n= \frac{k_F^3}{3\pi^2}=\frac{3}{4\pi r_s^3},
\]
!et
where $n=N_e/\Omega$, $N_e$ being the number of electrons, and $r_s$ is the radius of a sphere which represents the volum per conducting electron.  
It can be convenient to use the Bohr radius $a_0=\hbar^2/e^2m_e$.
For most metals we have a relation $r_s/a_0\sim 2-6$.  The quantity $r_s$ is dimensionless.

In exercise 6 we find that
the total energy
$E_0/N_e=\langle\Phi_{0}|\hat{H}|\Phi_{0}\rangle/N_e$ for
for this system to first order in the interaction is given as 
!bt
\[
E_0/N_e=\frac{e^2}{2a_0}\left[\frac{2.21}{r_s^2}-\frac{0.916}{r_s}\right].

The electron gas model allows closed form solutions for quantities like the 
single-particle Hartree-Fock energy.  The latter quantity is given by the following expression
!bt
\[
\varepsilon_{k}^{HF}=\frac{\hbar^{2}k^{2}}{2m}-\frac{e^{2}}
{V^{2}}\sum_{k'\leq
k_{F}}\int d{\bf r}e^{i({\bf k'}-{\bf k}){\bf r}}\int

(Hint: Introduce the convergence factor 
$e^{-\mu\vert{\bf r}-{\bf r}'\vert}$
in the potential and use  $\sum_{{\bf k}}\rightarrow

 * Rewrite the above result as a function of the density
!bt
\[
n= \frac{k_F^3}{3\pi^2}=\frac{3}{4\pi r_s^3},
\]
!et
where $n=N/V$, $N$ being the number of particles, and $r_s$ is the radius of a sphere which represents the volum per conducting electron.  
It can be convenient to use the Bohr radius $a_0=\hbar^2/e^2m$.

For most metals we have a relation $r_s/a_0\sim 2-6$.

Make a plot of the free electron energy and the Hartree-Fock energy and discuss the behavior around the Fermi surface. Extract also   the Hartree-Fock band width $\Delta\varepsilon^{HF}$ defined as
!bt
\[ 
\Delta\varepsilon^{HF}=\varepsilon_{k_{F}}^{HF}-
\varepsilon_{0}^{HF}.
\]
!et
Compare this results with the corresponding one for a free electron and comment your results. How large is the contribution due to the exchange term in the Hartree-Fock equation?\newline
 * We will now define a quantity called the effective mass.
For $\vert{\bf k}\vert$ near $k_{F}$, we can Taylor expand the Hartree-Fock energy as  
!bt
\[
\varepsilon_{k}^{HF}=\varepsilon_{k_{F}}^{HF}+
\left(\frac{\partial\varepsilon_{k}^{HF}}{\partial k}\right)_{k_{F}}(k-k_{F})+\dots
\]
!et
If we compare the latter with the corresponding expressiyon for the non-interacting system
!bt
\[
\varepsilon_{k}^{(0)}=\frac{\hbar^{2}k^{2}_{F}}{2m}+
\frac{\hbar^{2}k_{F}}{m}\left(k-k_{F}\right)+\dots ,
\]
!et
we can define the so-called effective Hartree-Fock mass as
!bt
\[
m_{HF}^{*}\equiv\hbar^{2}k_{F}\left(
\frac{\partial\varepsilon_{k}^{HF}}
{\partial k}\right)_{k_{F}}^{-1}
\]
!et
Compute $m_{HF}^{*}$ and comment your results after you have done 
point d). \newline
 * Show that the level density (the number of single-electron states per unit energy) can be written as
!bt
\[
n(\varepsilon)=\frac{Vk^{2}}{2\pi^{2}}\left(
\frac{\partial\varepsilon}{\partial k}\right)^{-1}
\]
!et

===== Exercises: Electron gas  =====
!bblock  Solution to exercise 5
We want to show that, given the Hartree-Fock equation for the electron gas
!bt
\[
\varepsilon_{k}^{HF}=\frac{\hbar^{2}k^{2}}{2m}-\frac{e^{2}}
{V^{2}}\sum_{p\leq
k_{F}}\int d{\bf r}\exp{(i({\bf p}-{\bf k}){\bf r})}\int
d{\bf r}'\frac{\exp{(i({\bf k}-{\bf p}){\bf r}'})}
{\vert{\bf r}-{\bf r'}\vert}
\]
!et
the single-particle energy can be written as
!bt
\[
\varepsilon_{k}^{HF}=\frac{\hbar^{2}k^{2}}{2m}-\frac{e^{2}
k_{F}}{2\pi}
\left[
2+\frac{k_{F}^{2}-k^{2}}{kk_{F}}ln\left\vert\frac{k+k_{F}}
{k-k_{F}}\right\vert
\right].
\]
!et
We introduce the convergence factor 
$e^{-\mu\vert{\bf r}-{\bf r}'\vert}$
in the potential and use  $\sum_{{\bf k}}\rightarrow
\frac{V}{(2\pi)^{3}}\int d{\bf k}$. We can then rewrite the integral as 
!bt
\[
\frac{e^{2}}
{V^{2}}\sum_{k'\leq
k_{F}}\int d{\bf r}\exp{(i({\bf k'}-{\bf k}){\bf r})}\int
d{\bf r}'\frac{\exp{(i({\bf k}-{\bf p}){\bf r}'})}
{\vert{\bf r}-{\bf r'}\vert}=\frac{e^{2}}{V (2\pi)^3}  \int d{\bf r}\int
\frac{d{\bf r}'}{\vert{\bf r}-{\bf r'}\vert}\exp{(-i{\bf k}({\bf r}-{\bf r}'))}\int d{\bf p}\exp{(i{\bf p}({\bf r}-{\bf r}'))},
\]
!et
and introducing the abovementioned convergence factor we have
!bt
\[
\lim_{\mu \to 0}\frac{e^{2}}{V (2\pi)^3}  \int d{\bf r}\int d{\bf r}'\frac{\exp{(-\mu\vert{\bf r}-{\bf r}'\vert})}{\vert{\bf r}-{\bf r'}\vert}\int d{\bf p}\exp{(i({\bf p}-{\bf k})({\bf r}-{\bf r}'))}.
\]
!et
With a change variables to ${\bf x} = {\bf r}-{\bf r}'$ and ${\bf y}={\bf r}'$ we rewrite the last integral as
!bt
\[
\lim_{\mu \to 0}\frac{e^{2}}{V (2\pi)^3}  \int d{\bf p}\int d{\bf y}\int d{\bf x}\exp{(i({\bf p}-{\bf k}){\bf x})}\frac{\exp{(-\mu\vert{\bf x}\vert})}{\vert{\bf x}\vert}.
\]
!et
The integration over ${\bf x}$ can be performed using spherical coordinates, resulting in (with $x=\vert {\bf x}\vert$)
!bt
\[
\int d{\bf x}\exp{(i({\bf p}-{\bf k}){\bf x})}\frac{\exp{(-\mu\vert{\bf x}\vert})}{\vert{\bf x}\vert}=\int x^2 dx d\phi d\cos{(\theta)}\exp{(i({\bf p}-{\bf k})x\cos{(\theta))}}\frac{\exp{(-\mu x)}}{x},
\]
!et
which yields
!bt
\[
4\pi \int dx \frac{ \sin{(\vert {\bf p}-{\bf k}\vert)x} }{\vert {\bf p}-{\bf k}\vert}{\exp{(-\mu x)}}= \frac{4\pi}{\mu^2+\vert {\bf p}-{\bf k}\vert^2}.
\]
!et
This results gives us 
!bt
\[
\lim_{\mu \to 0}\frac{e^{2}}{V (2\pi)^3}  \int d{\bf p}\int d{\bf y}\frac{4\pi}{\mu^2+\vert {\bf p}-{\bf k}\vert^2}=\lim_{\mu \to 0}\frac{e^{2}}{ 2\pi^2}  \int d{\bf p}\frac{1}{\mu^2+\vert {\bf p}-{\bf k}\vert^2},
\]
!et
where we have used that the integrand on teh left-hand side does not depend on ${\bf y}$ and that $\int d{\bf y}=V$.Introducing spherical coordinates we can rewrite the integral as 
!bt
\[
\lim_{\mu \to 0}\frac{e^{2}}{ 2\pi^2}  \int d{\bf p}\frac{1}{\mu^2+\vert {\bf p}-{\bf k}\vert^2}=\frac{e^{2}}{ 2\pi^2}  \int d{\bf p}\frac{1}{\vert {\bf p}-{\bf k}\vert^2}=\frac{e^{2}}{\pi}  \int_0^{k_F} p^2dp\int_0^{\pi} d\theta\cos{(\theta)}\frac{1}{p^2+k^2-2pk\cos{(\theta)}},
\]
!et
and with the change of variables $\cos{(\theta)}=u$ we have 
!bt
\[
\frac{e^{2}}{\pi}  \int_0^{k_F} p^2dp\int_{0}^{\pi} d\theta\cos{(\theta)}\frac{1}{p^2+k^2-2pk\cos{(\theta)}}=\frac{e^{2}}{\pi}  \int_0^{k_F} p^2dp\int_{-1}^{1} du\frac{1}{p^2+k^2-2pku},
\]
!et
which gives
!bt
\[
\frac{e^{2}}{k\pi}  \int_0^{k_F} pdp\left\{ln(\vert p+k\vert)-ln(\vert p-k\vert)\right\},
\]
!et
and introducing new variables $x=p+k$ and $y=p-k$, we obtain after some straightforward reordering of the integral
!bt
\[
\frac{e^{2}}{k\pi}\left[
kk_F+\frac{k_{F}^{2}-k^{2}}{kk_{F}}ln\left\vert\frac{k+k_{F}}
{k-k_{F}}\right\vert
\right],
\]
!et
which gives the abovementioned expression for the single-particle energy.

Introducing the dimensionless quantity $x=k/k_F$ and the function
!bt
\[
F(x) = \frac{1}{2}+\frac{1-x^2}{4x}\ln{\left\vert \frac{1+x}{1-x}\right\vert},
\]
!et
we can rewrite the single-particle Hartree-Fock energy as 
!bt
\[
\varepsilon_{k}^{HF}=\frac{\hbar^{2}k^{2}}{2m}-\frac{2e^{2}
k_{F}}{\pi}F(k/k_F),
\]
!et
and dividing by the non-interacting contribution at the Fermi level, 
!bt
\[
\varepsilon_{0}^{HF}=\frac{\hbar^{2}k_F^{2}}{2m},
\]
!et
we have
!bt
\[
\frac{\varepsilon_{k}^{HF} }{\varepsilon_{0}^{HF}}=x^2-\frac{e^2m}{\hbar^2 k_F\pi}F(x)=x^2-\frac{4}{\pi k_Fa_0}F(x),
\]
!et
where $a_0=0.0529$ nm is the Bohr radius, setting thereby a natural length scale. 
By introducing the radius $r_s$ of a sphere whose volume is the volume occupied by each electron, we can rewrite the previous equation in terms of $r_s$ using that the electron density $n=N/V$
!bt
\[
n=\frac{k_F^3}{3\pi^2} = \frac{3}{4\pi r_s^3},
\]
!et
we have (with $k_F=1.92/r_s$,
!bt
\[
\frac{\varepsilon_{k}^{HF} }{\varepsilon_{0}^{HF}}=x^2-\frac{e^2m}{\hbar^2 k_F\pi}F(x)=x^2-\frac{r_s}{a_0}0.663F(x),
\]
!et
with $r_s \sim 2-6$ for most metals. 

We can now define the so-called bandwidth, that is the scatter between the maximal and the minimal value of the electrons in the conductance band of a metal (up to the Fermi level). For $x=1$, which corresponds to

Find also the number operator $\hat{N}$ and find a corresponding expression for the interaction
$\hat{V}$ expressed with creation and annihilation operators.   The expression for the interaction

We have to show first  that
!bt
\[
\hat{H}_{b}=\frac{e^2}{2}\frac{N_e^2}{\Omega}\frac{4\pi}{\mu^2},
\]
!et
and
!bt
\[
\hat{H}_{el-b}=-e^2\frac{N_e^2}{\Omega}\frac{4\pi}{\mu^2}.
\]
!et
And then that the final Hamiltonian can be written as 
!bt
\[
H=H_{0}+H_{I},
\]
!et
with
!bt
\[
H_{0}={\displaystyle\sum_{{\bf k}\sigma}}
\frac{\hbar^{2}k^{2}}{2m_e}a_{{\bf k}\sigma}^{\dagger}
a_{{\bf k}\sigma},
\]
!et
and
!bt
\[
H_{I}=\frac{e^{2}}{2\Omega}{\displaystyle\sum_{\sigma_{1}
\sigma_{2}}}{\displaystyle
\sum_{{\bf q}\neq 0,{\bf k},{\bf p}}}\frac{4\pi}{q^{2}}
a_{{\bf k}+{\bf q},\sigma_{1}}^{\dagger}
a_{{\bf p}-{\bf q},\sigma_{2}}^{\dagger}
a_{{\bf p}\sigma_{2}}a_{{\bf k}\sigma_{1}}.

Let us now calculate the following part of the Hamiltonian
!bt
\[ \hat H_b = \frac{e^2}{2} \iint \frac{n({\bf r}) n({\bf r}')e^{-\mu|{\bf r} - {\bf r}'|}}{|{\bf r} - {\bf r}'|} d{\bf r} d{\bf r}' , 
\]
!et
where $n({\bf r}) = N_e/\Omega$, the density of the positive background charge. We define ${\bf r}_{12} = {\bf r} - {\bf r}'$, resulting in $d{\bf r}_{12} = d{\bf r}$, and allowing us to rewrite the integral as
!bt
\[ 
\hat H_b = \frac{e^2 N_e^2}{2\Omega^2} \iint \frac{e^{-\mu |{\bf r}_{12}|}}{|{\bf r}_{12}|} d{\bf r}_{12} d{\bf r}' = \frac{e^2 N_e^2}{2\Omega} \int \frac{e^{-\mu |{\bf r}_{12}|}}{|{\bf r}_{12}|} d{\bf r}_{12} . 
\]
!et
Here we have used that $\int \! {\bf r} = \Omega$. We change to spherical coordinates and the lack of angle 
dependencies yields a factor $4\pi$, resulting in
!bt
\[ 
\hat H_b = \frac{4\pi e^2 N_e^2}{2\Omega} \int_0^\infty re^{-\mu r} \, \mathrm{d} r . 
\]
!et


Solving by partial integration
!bt
\[ \int_0^\infty re^{-\mu r} \, \mathrm{d} r = \left[ -\frac{r}{\mu} e^{-\mu r} \right]_0^\infty + \frac{1}{\mu} \int_0^\infty e^{-\mu r} \, \mathrm{d} r
= \frac{1}{\mu} \left[ - \frac{1}{\mu} e^{-\mu r} \right]_0^\infty = \frac{1}{\mu^2}, 
\]
!et
gives
!bt
\[
\hat{H}_b = \frac{e^2}{2} \frac{N_e^2}{\Omega} \frac{4\pi}{\mu^2} .
\]
!et
The next term is 
!bt
\[ 
\hat H_{el-b} = -e^2 \sum_{i = 1}^N \int \frac{n({\bf r}) e^{-\mu |{\bf r} - {\bf x}_i|}}{|{\bf r} - {\bf x}_i|} {\bf r} . 
\]
!et
Inserting  $n({\bf r})$ and changing variables in the same way as in the previous integral ${\bf y} = {\bf r} - {\bf x}_i$, we get $\mathrm{d}^3 {\bf y} = \mathrm{d}^3 {\bf r}$. This gives
!bt
\[ 
\hat H_{el-b} = -\frac{e^2 N_e}{\Omega} \sum_{i = 1^N} \int \frac{e^{-\mu |{\bf y}|}}{|{\bf y}|} \, \mathrm{d}^3 {\bf y}
=  -\frac{4\pi e^2 N_e}{\Omega} \sum_{i = 1}^N \int_0^\infty y e^{-\mu y} \mathrm{d} y. 
\]
!et
We have already seen this  type of integral. The answer is 
!bt
\[ 
\hat H_{el-b} = -\frac{4\pi e^2 N_e}{\Omega} \sum_{i = 1}^N \frac{1}{\mu^2}, 
\]
!et
which gives
!bt
\[
\hat H_{el-b} = -e^2 \frac{N_e^2}{\Omega} \frac{4\pi}{\mu^2} .
\]
!et

Finally, we need to evaluate $\hat H_{el}$. This term reads
!bt
\[ 
\hat H_{el} = \sum_{i=1}^{N_e} \frac{\hat{\vec p}_i^2}{2m_e} + \frac{e^2}{2} \sum_{i \neq j} \frac{e^{-\mu |{\bf r}_i - {\bf r}_j|}}{{\bf r}_i - {\bf r}_j} . 
\]
!et
The last term represents the repulsion between two electrons. It is a central symmetric interaction
and is translationally invariant. The potential is given by the expression
!bt
\[ 
v(|{\bf r}|) = e^2 \frac{e^{\mu|{\bf r}|}}{|{\bf r}|}, 
\]
!et
which we derived in connection with the Hartree-Fock derivation.
