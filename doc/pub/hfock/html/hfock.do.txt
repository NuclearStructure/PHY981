===== Why Hartree-Fock? Derivation of Hartree-Fock equations in coordinate space =====
!bblock
Hartree-Fock (HF) theory is an algorithm for finding an approximative expression for the ground state of a given Hamiltonian. The basic ingredients are
 *  Define a single-particle basis $\{\psi_{\alpha}\}$ so that
!bt
\[ 
\hat{h}^{\mathrm{HF}}\psi_{\alpha} = \varepsilon_{\alpha}\psi_{\alpha}
\]
!et
with the Hartree-Fock Hamiltonian defined as
!bt
\[
\hat{h}^{\mathrm{HF}}=\hat{t}+\hat{u}_{\mathrm{ext}}+\hat{u}^{\mathrm{HF}}
\]
!et
 *  The term  $\hat{u}^{\mathrm{HF}}$ is a single-particle potential to be determined by the HF algorithm.
 *  The HF algorithm means to choose $\hat{u}^{\mathrm{HF}}$ in order to have 
!bt
\[ \langle \hat{H} \rangle = E^{\mathrm{HF}}= \langle \Phi_0 | \hat{H}|\Phi_0 \rangle
\]
!et
that is to find a local minimum with a Slater determinant $\Phi_0$ being the ansatz for the ground state. 
 *  The variational principle ensures that $E^{\mathrm{HF}} \ge E_0$, with $E_0$ the exact ground state energy.

===== Why Hartree-Fock? Derivation of Hartree-Fock equations in coordinate space =====
!bblock
We will show that the Hartree-Fock Hamiltonian $\hat{h}^{\mathrm{HF}}$ equals our definition of the operator $\hat{f}$ discussed in connection with the new definition of the normal-ordered Hamiltonian (see later lectures), that is we have, for a specific matrix element
!bt
\[
\langle p |\hat{h}^{\mathrm{HF}}| q \rangle =\langle p |\hat{f}| q \rangle=\langle p|\hat{t}+\hat{u}_{\mathrm{ext}}|q \rangle +\sum_{i\le F} \langle pi | \hat{V} | qi\rangle_{AS},
\]
!et
meaning that
!bt
\[
\langle p|\hat{u}^{\mathrm{HF}}|q\rangle = \sum_{i\le F} \langle pi | \hat{V} | qi\rangle_{AS}.
\]
!et
The so-called Hartree-Fock potential $\hat{u}^{\mathrm{HF}}$ brings an explicit medium dependence due to the summation over all single-particle states below the Fermi level $F$. It brings also in an explicit dependence on the two-body interaction (in nuclear physics we can also have complicated three- or higher-body forces). The two-body interaction, with its contribution from the other bystanding fermions, creates an effective mean field in which a given fermion moves, in addition to the external potential $\hat{u}_{\mathrm{ext}}$ which confines the motion of the fermion. For systems like nuclei, there is no external confining potential. Nuclei are examples of self-bound systems, where the binding arises due to the intrinsic nature of the strong force. For nuclear systems thus, there would be no external one-body potential in the Hartree-Fock Hamiltonian.

===== Variational Calculus and Lagrangian Multipliers  =====
!bblock 
The calculus of variations involves 
problems where the quantity to be minimized or maximized is an integral. 

In the general case we have an integral of the type
!bt
\[ 
E[\Phi]= \int_a^b f(\Phi(x),\frac{\partial \Phi}{\partial x},x)dx,
\]
!et
where $E$ is the quantity which is sought minimized or maximized.
The problem is that although $f$ is a function of the variables $\Phi$, $\partial \Phi/\partial x$ and $x$, the exact dependence of
$\Phi$ on $x$ is not known.  This means again that even though the integral has fixed limits $a$ and $b$, the path of integration is
not known. In our case the unknown quantities are the single-particle wave functions and we wish to choose an integration path which makes
the functional $E[\Phi]$ stationary. This means that we want to find minima, or maxima or saddle points. In physics we search normally for minima.
Our task is therefore to find the minimum of $E[\Phi]$ so that its variation $\delta E$ is zero  subject to specific
constraints. In our case the constraints appear as the integral which expresses the orthogonality of the  single-particle wave functions.
The constraints can be treated via the technique of Lagrangian multipliers

===== Variational Calculus and Lagrangian Multipliers  =====
!bblock 
Let us specialize to the expectation value of the energy for one particle in three-dimensions.
This expectation value reads
!bt
\[
  E=\int dxdydz \psi^*(x,y,z) \hat{H} \psi(x,y,z),
\]
!et
with the constraint
!bt
\[
 \int dxdydz \psi^*(x,y,z) \psi(x,y,z)=1,
\]
!et
and a Hamiltonian
!bt
\[
\hat{H}=-\frac{1}{2}\nabla^2+V(x,y,z).
\]
!et
We will, for the sake of notational convenience,  skip the variables $x,y,z$ below, and write for example $V(x,y,z)=V$.
!eblock

!split
===== Variational Calculus and Lagrangian Multipliers  =====
!bblock 
The integral involving the kinetic energy can be written as, with the function $\psi$ vanishing
strongly for large values of $x,y,z$ (given here by the limits $a$ and $b$), 
!bt
 \[
  \int_a^b dxdydz \psi^* \left(-\frac{1}{2}\nabla^2\right) \psi dxdydz = \psi^*\nabla\psi|_a^b+\int_a^b dxdydz\frac{1}{2}\nabla\psi^*\nabla\psi.
\]
!et
We will drop the limits $a$ and $b$ in the remaining discussion. 
Inserting this expression into the expectation value for the energy and taking the variational minimum  we obtain
!bt
\[
\delta E = \delta \left\{\int dxdydz\left( \frac{1}{2}\nabla\psi^*\nabla\psi+V\psi^*\psi\right)\right\} = 0.
\]
!et
!eblock

!split
===== Variational Calculus and Lagrangian Multipliers  =====
!bblock 
The constraint appears in integral form as 
!bt
\[
 \int dxdydz \psi^* \psi=\mathrm{constant},
\]
!et
and multiplying with a Lagrangian multiplier $\lambda$ and taking the variational minimum we obtain the final variational equation
!bt
\[
\delta \left\{\int dxdydz\left( \frac{1}{2}\nabla\psi^*\nabla\psi+V\psi^*\psi-\lambda\psi^*\psi\right)\right\} = 0.
\]
!et
We introduce the function  $f$
!bt
\[
  f =  \frac{1}{2}\nabla\psi^*\nabla\psi+V\psi^*\psi-\lambda\psi^*\psi=
\frac{1}{2}(\psi^*_x\psi_x+\psi^*_y\psi_y+\psi^*_z\psi_z)+V\psi^*\psi-\lambda\psi^*\psi,
\]
!et
where we have skipped the dependence on $x,y,z$ and introduced the shorthand $\psi_x$, $\psi_y$ and $\psi_z$  for the various derivatives.
!eblock

!split
===== Variational Calculus and Lagrangian Multipliers  =====
!bblock 
For $\psi^*$ the Euler-Lagrange  equations yield
!bt
\[
\frac{\partial f}{\partial \psi^*}- \frac{\partial }{\partial x}\frac{\partial f}{\partial \psi^*_x}-\frac{\partial }{\partial y}\frac{\partial f}{\partial \psi^*_y}-\frac{\partial }{\partial z}\frac{\partial f}{\partial \psi^*_z}=0,
\] 
!et
which results in 
!bt
\[
    -\frac{1}{2}(\psi_{xx}+\psi_{yy}+\psi_{zz})+V\psi=\lambda \psi.
\]
!et
We can then identify the  Lagrangian multiplier as the energy of the system. The last equation is 
nothing but the standard 
Schroedinger equation and the variational  approach discussed here provides 
a powerful method for obtaining approximate solutions of the wave function.

===== Definitions and notations =====
!bblock
Before we proceed we need some definitions.
We will assume that the interacting part of the Hamiltonian
can be approximated by a two-body interaction.
This means that our Hamiltonian is written as the sum of some onebody part and a twobody part
!bt
\begin{equation}
    \hat{H} = \hat{H}_0 + \hat{H}_I 
    = \sum_{i=1}^A \hat{h}_0(x_i) + \sum_{i < j}^A \hat{v}(r_{ij}),
label{Hnuclei}
\end{equation}
!et
with 
!bt
\begin{equation}
  H_0=\sum_{i=1}^A \hat{h}_0(x_i).
label{hinuclei}
\end{equation}
!et
The onebody part $u_{\mathrm{ext}}(x_i)$ is normally approximated by a harmonic oscillator potential or the Coulomb interaction an electron feels from the nucleus. However, other potentials are fully possible, such as 
one derived from the self-consistent solution of the Hartree-Fock equations to be discussed here.

===== Definitions and notations =====
!bblock
Our Hamiltonian is invariant under the permutation (interchange) of two particles.
Since we deal with fermions however, the total wave function is antisymmetric.
Let $\hat{P}$ be an operator which interchanges two particles.
Due to the symmetries we have ascribed to our Hamiltonian, this operator commutes with the total Hamiltonian,
!bt 
\[
[\hat{H},\hat{P}] = 0,
 \]
!et
meaning that $\Psi_{\lambda}(x_1, x_2, \dots , x_A)$ is an eigenfunction of 
$\hat{P}$ as well, that is
!bt 
\[
\hat{P}_{ij}\Psi_{\lambda}(x_1, x_2, \dots,x_i,\dots,x_j,\dots,x_A)=
\beta\Psi_{\lambda}(x_1, x_2, \dots,x_i,\dots,x_j,\dots,x_A),
\]
!et
where $\beta$ is the eigenvalue of $\hat{P}$. We have introduced the suffix $ij$ in order to indicate that we permute particles $i$ and $j$.
The Pauli principle tells us that the total wave function for a system of fermions
has to be antisymmetric, resulting in the eigenvalue $\beta = -1$.   
!eblock

!split
===== Definitions and notations =====
!bblock
In our case we assume that  we can approximate the exact eigenfunction with a Slater determinant
!bt
\begin{equation}
   \Phi(x_1, x_2,\dots ,x_A,\alpha,\beta,\dots, \sigma)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{A!}}
\left| \begin{array}{ccccc} \psi_{\alpha}(x_1)& \psi_{\alpha}(x_2)& \dots & \dots & \psi_{\alpha}(x_A)\\
                            \psi_{\beta}(x_1)&\psi_{\beta}(x_2)& \dots & \dots & \psi_{\beta}(x_A)\\  
                            \dots & \dots & \dots & \dots & \dots \\
                            \dots & \dots & \dots & \dots & \dots \\
                     \psi_{\sigma}(x_1)&\psi_{\sigma}(x_2)& \dots & \dots & \psi_{\sigma}(x_A)\end{array} \right|, label{eq:HartreeFockDet}
\end{equation}
!et
where  $x_i$  stand for the coordinates and spin values of a particle $i$ and $\alpha,\beta,\dots, \gamma$ 
are quantum numbers needed to describe remaining quantum numbers.  
!eblock

!split
===== Definitions and notations =====
!bblock
The single-particle function $\psi_{\alpha}(x_i)$  are eigenfunctions of the onebody
Hamiltonian $h_i$, that is
!bt 
\[
\hat{h}_0(x_i)=\hat{t}(x_i) + \hat{u}_{\mathrm{ext}}(x_i),
\]
!et
with eigenvalues 
!bt 
\[
\hat{h}_0(x_i) \psi_{\alpha}(x_i)=\left(\hat{t}(x_i) + \hat{u}_{\mathrm{ext}}(x_i)\right)\psi_{\alpha}(x_i)=\varepsilon_{\alpha}\psi_{\alpha}(x_i).
\]
!et
The energies $\varepsilon_{\alpha}$ are the so-called non-interacting single-particle energies, or unperturbed energies. 
The total energy is in this case the sum over all  single-particle energies, if no two-body or more complicated
many-body interactions are present.
!eblock

!split
===== Definitions and notations =====
!bblock
Let us denote the ground state energy by $E_0$. According to the
variational principle we have
!bt
\[
  E_0 \le E[\Phi] = \int \Phi^*\hat{H}\Phi d\mathbf{\tau}
\]
!et
where $\Phi$ is a trial function which we assume to be normalized
!bt
\[
  \int \Phi^*\Phi d\mathbf{\tau} = 1,
\]
!et
where we have used the shorthand $d\mathbf{\tau}=dx_1dr_2\dots dr_A$.
!eblock

!split
===== Definitions and notations =====
!bblock
In the Hartree-Fock method the trial function is the Slater
determinant of Eq.~(ref{eq:HartreeFockDet}) which can be rewritten as 
!bt
\[
  \Phi(x_1,x_2,\dots,x_A,\alpha,\beta,\dots,\nu) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{A!}}\sum_{P} (-)^P\hat{P}\psi_{\alpha}(x_1)
    \psi_{\beta}(x_2)\dots\psi_{\nu}(x_A)=\sqrt{A!}\hat{A}\Phi_H,
\]
!et
where we have introduced the antisymmetrization operator $\hat{A}$ defined by the 
summation over all possible permutations of two particles.
!eblock

!split
===== Definitions and notations =====
!bblock
It is defined as
!bt
\begin{equation}
  \hat{A} = \frac{1}{A!}\sum_{p} (-)^p\hat{P},
label{antiSymmetryOperator}
\end{equation}
!et
with $p$ standing for the number of permutations. We have introduced for later use the so-called
Hartree-function, defined by the simple product of all possible single-particle functions
!bt
\[
  \Phi_H(x_1,x_2,\dots,x_A,\alpha,\beta,\dots,\nu) =
  \psi_{\alpha}(x_1)
    \psi_{\beta}(x_2)\dots\psi_{\nu}(x_A).
\]
!et
!eblock

!split
===== Definitions and notations =====
!bblock
Both $\hat{H}_0$ and $\hat{H}_I$ are invariant under all possible permutations of any two particles
and hence commute with $\hat{A}$
!bt
\begin{equation}
  [H_0,\hat{A}] = [H_I,\hat{A}] = 0. label{commutionAntiSym}
\end{equation}
!et
Furthermore, $\hat{A}$ satisfies
!bt
\begin{equation}
  \hat{A}^2 = \hat{A},  label{AntiSymSquared}
\end{equation}
!et
since every permutation of the Slater
determinant reproduces it.

The expectation value of $\hat{H}_0$ 
!bt
\[
  \int \Phi^*\hat{H}_0\Phi d\mathbf{\tau} 
  = A! \int \Phi_H^*\hat{A}\hat{H}_0\hat{A}\Phi_H d\mathbf{\tau}
\]
!et
is readily reduced to
!bt
\[
  \int \Phi^*\hat{H}_0\Phi d\mathbf{\tau} 
  = A! \int \Phi_H^*\hat{H}_0\hat{A}\Phi_H d\mathbf{\tau},
\]
!et
where we have used Eqs.~(ref{commutionAntiSym}) and
(ref{AntiSymSquared}). The next step is to replace the antisymmetrization
operator by its definition and to
replace $\hat{H}_0$ with the sum of one-body operators
!bt
\[
  \int \Phi^*\hat{H}_0\Phi  d\mathbf{\tau}
  = \sum_{i=1}^A \sum_{p} (-)^p\int 
  \Phi_H^*\hat{h}_0\hat{P}\Phi_H d\mathbf{\tau}.
\]
!et
!eblock

!split
===== Definitions and notations =====
!bblock
The integral vanishes if two or more particles are permuted in only one
of the Hartree-functions $\Phi_H$ because the individual single-particle wave functions are
orthogonal. We obtain then
!bt
\[
  \int \Phi^*\hat{H}_0\Phi  d\mathbf{\tau}= \sum_{i=1}^A \int \Phi_H^*\hat{h}_0\Phi_H  d\mathbf{\tau}.
\]
!et
Orthogonality of the single-particle functions allows us to further simplify the integral, and we
arrive at the following expression for the expectation values of the
sum of one-body Hamiltonians 
!bt
\begin{equation}
  \int \Phi^*\hat{H}_0\Phi  d\mathbf{\tau}
  = \sum_{\mu=1}^A \int \psi_{\mu}^*(x)\hat{h}_0\psi_{\mu}(x)dx
  d\mathbf{r}.
  label{H1Expectation}
\end{equation}
!et
!eblock

!split
===== Definitions and notations =====
!bblock
We introduce the following shorthand for the above integral
!bt
\[
\langle \mu | \hat{h}_0 | \mu \rangle = \int \psi_{\mu}^*(x)\hat{h}_0\psi_{\mu}(x)dx,
\]
!et
and rewrite Eq.~(ref{H1Expectation}) as
!bt
\begin{equation}
  \int \Phi^*\hat{H}_0\Phi  d\tau
  = \sum_{\mu=1}^A \langle \mu | \hat{h}_0 | \mu \rangle.
  label{H1Expectation1}
\end{equation}
!et
!eblock

!split
===== Definitions and notations =====
!bblock
The expectation value of the two-body part of the Hamiltonian is obtained in a
similar manner. We have
!bt
\[
  \int \Phi^*\hat{H}_I\Phi d\mathbf{\tau} 
  = A! \int \Phi_H^*\hat{A}\hat{H}_I\hat{A}\Phi_H d\mathbf{\tau},
\]
!et
which reduces to
!bt
\[
 \int \Phi^*\hat{H}_I\Phi d\mathbf{\tau} 
  = \sum_{i\le j=1}^A \sum_{p} (-)^p\int 
  \Phi_H^*\hat{v}(r_{ij})\hat{P}\Phi_H d\mathbf{\tau},
\]
!et
by following the same arguments as for the one-body
Hamiltonian. 
!eblock

!split
===== Definitions and notations =====
!bblock
Because of the dependence on the inter-particle distance $r_{ij}$,  permutations of
any two particles no longer vanish, and we get
!bt
\[
  \int \Phi^*\hat{H}_I\Phi d\mathbf{\tau} 
  = \sum_{i < j=1}^A \int  
  \Phi_H^*\hat{v}(r_{ij})(1-P_{ij})\Phi_H d\mathbf{\tau}.
\]
!et
where $P_{ij}$ is the permutation operator that interchanges
particle $i$ and particle $j$. Again we use the assumption that the single-particle wave functions
are orthogonal. 
!eblock


!split
===== Definitions and notations =====
!bblock
We obtain
!bt
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
  \int \Phi^*\hat{H}_I\Phi d\mathbf{\tau} 
  = \frac{1}{2}\sum_{\mu=1}^A\sum_{\nu=1}^A
    &\left[ \int \psi_{\mu}^*(x_i)\psi_{\nu}^*(x_j)\hat{v}(r_{ij})\psi_{\mu}(x_i)\psi_{\nu}(x_j)
    dx_idx_j \right.\\
  &\left.
  - \int \psi_{\mu}^*(x_i)\psi_{\nu}^*(x_j)

  \right]. label{H2Expectation}
\end{split}
\end{equation}
!et
The first term is the so-called direct term. It is frequently also called the  Hartree term, 
while the second is due to the Pauli principle and is called
the exchange term or just the Fock term.
The factor  $1/2$ is introduced because we now run over
all pairs twice.

The last equation allows us to  introduce some further definitions.  
The single-particle wave functions $\psi_{\mu}(x)$, defined by the quantum numbers $\mu$ and $x$

Although the variations $\delta\psi$ and $\delta\psi^*$ are not
independent, they may in fact be treated as such, so that the 
terms dependent on either $\delta\psi$ and $\delta\psi^*$ individually 
may be set equal to zero. To see this, simply 
replace the arbitrary variation $\delta\psi$ by $i\delta\psi$, so that
$\delta\psi^*$ is replaced by $-i\delta\psi^*$, and combine the two
equations. We thus arrive at the Hartree-Fock equations
!bt
\begin{equation}
\left[ -\frac{1}{2}\nabla_i^2+ \sum_{\nu=1}^A\int \psi_{\nu}^*(x_j)\hat{v}(r_{ij})\psi_{\nu}(x_j)dx_j \right]\psi_{\mu}(x_i) - \left[ \sum_{{\nu}=1}^A \int\psi_{\nu}^*(x_j)\hat{v}(r_{ij})\psi_{\mu}(x_j) dx_j\right] \psi_{\nu}(x_i) = \epsilon_{\mu} \psi_{\mu}(x_i).  label{eq:hartreefockcoordinatespace}
\end{equation}
!et
Notice that the integration $\int dx_j$ implies an
integration over the spatial coordinates $\mathbf{r_j}$ and a summation
over the spin-coordinate of fermion $j$. We note that the factor of $1/2$ in front of the sum involving the two-body interaction, has been removed. This is due to the fact that we need to vary both $\delta\psi_{\mu}^*$ and
$\delta\psi_{\nu}^*$. Using the symmetry properties of the two-body interaction and interchanging $\mu$ and $\nu$
as summation indices, we obtain two identical terms.

The two first terms in the last equation are the one-body kinetic energy and the
electron-nucleus potential. The third or *direct* term is the averaged electronic repulsion of the other
electrons. As written, the
term includes the *self-interaction* of 
electrons when $\mu=\nu$. The self-interaction is cancelled in the fourth
term, or the *exchange* term. The exchange term results from our
inclusion of the Pauli principle and the assumed determinantal form of
the wave-function. Equation (ref{eq:hartreefockcoordinatespace}), in addition to the kinetic energy and the attraction from the atomic nucleus that confines the motion of a single electron,   represents now the motion of a single-particle modified by the two-body interaction. The additional contribution to the Schroedinger equation due to the two-body interaction, represents a mean field set up by all the other bystanding electrons, the latter given by the sum over all single-particle states occupied by $N$ electrons. 

The Hartree-Fock equation is an example of an integro-differential equation. These equations involve repeated calculations of integrals, in addition to the solution of a set of coupled differential equations. 
The Hartree-Fock equations can also be rewritten in terms of an eigenvalue problem. The solution of an eigenvalue problem represents often a more practical algorithm and the  solution of  coupled  integro-differential equations.
This alternative derivation of the Hartree-Fock equations is given below.

Having performed a  Hartree-Fock calculation for neutral sodium would then allows us to compute the
ionization energy by using the single-particle energy for the $3s$ states, namely $\epsilon_{3s}^{\mathrm{HF}}$. 

From these considerations, we see that Hartree-Fock theory allows us to make a connection between experimental 
observables (here ionization and affinity energies) and the underlying interactions between particles.  
In this sense, we are now linking the dynamics and structure of a many-body system with the laws of motion which govern the system. Our approach is a reductionistic one, meaning that we want to understand the laws of motion

Similalry, we could interpret
!bt
\[
BE(^{17}\mathrm{O})-BE(^{16}\mathrm{O})\approx \epsilon_{0d^{\nu}_{5/2}}^{\mathrm{HF}}, 
\]

and 
!bt
\[
BE(^{17}\mathrm{F})-BE(^{16}\mathrm{O})\approx\epsilon_{0d^{\pi}_{5/2}}^{\mathrm{HF}}.

We can continue like this for all $A\pm 1$ nuclei where $A$ is a good closed-shell (or subshell closure)
nucleus. Examples are ${}^{22}\mbox{O}$, ${}^{24}\mbox{O}$, ${}^{40}\mbox{Ca}$, ${}^{48}\mbox{Ca}$, ${}^{52}\mbox{Ca}$, ${}^{54}\mbox{Ca}$, ${}^{56}\mbox{Ni}$, 
${}^{68}\mbox{Ni}$, ${}^{78}\mbox{Ni}$, ${}^{90}\mbox{Zr}$, ${}^{88}\mbox{Sr}$, ${}^{100}\mbox{Sn}$, ${}^{132}\mbox{Sn}$ and ${}^{208}\mbox{Pb}$, to mention some possile cases.

We can thus make our first interpretation of the separation energies in terms of the simplest
possible many-body theory. 
If we also recall that the so-called energy gap for neutrons (or protons) is defined as
!bt
\[
\Delta S_n= 2BE(N,Z)-BE(N-1,Z)-BE(N+1,Z),
\]
!et
for neutrons and the corresponding gap for protons
!bt
\[
\Delta S_p= 2BE(N,Z)-BE(N,Z-1)-BE(N,Z+1),
\]
!et
we can define the neutron and proton energy gaps for ${}^{16}\mbox{O}$ as
!bt
\[
\Delta S_{\nu}=\epsilon_{0d^{\nu}_{5/2}}^{\mathrm{HF}}-\epsilon_{0p^{\nu}_{1/2}}^{\mathrm{HF}}, 
\]

and 
!bt
\[
\Delta S_{\pi}=\epsilon_{0d^{\pi}_{5/2}}^{\mathrm{HF}}-\epsilon_{0p^{\pi}_{1/2}}^{\mathrm{HF}}.

===== Exercises: Derivation of Hartree-Fock equations  =====
!bblock  Exercise 1
Consider a Slater determinant built up of single-particle orbitals $\psi_{\lambda}$, 
with $\lambda = 1,2,\dots,N$.

The unitary transformation
!bt
\[
\psi_a  = \sum_{\lambda} C_{a\lambda}\phi_{\lambda},
\]
!et
brings us into the new basis.  
The new basis has quantum numbers $a=1,2,\dots,N$.
Show that the new basis is orthonormal.
Show that the new Slater determinant constructed from the new single-particle wave functions can be
written as the determinant based on the previous basis and the determinant of the matrix $C$.
Show that the old and the new Slater determinants are equal up to a complex constant with absolute value unity.
(Hint, $C$ is a unitary matrix).

Consider the  Slater  determinant

\[
\Phi_{0}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{n!}}\sum_{p}(-)^{p}P
