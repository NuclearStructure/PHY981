    "The so-called Hartree-Fock potential $\\hat{u}^{\\mathrm{HF}}$ brings an explicit medium dependence due to the summation over all single-particle states below the Fermi level $F$. It brings also in an explicit dependence on the two-body interaction (in nuclear physics we can also have complicated three- or higher-body forces). The two-body interaction, with its contribution from the other bystanding fermions, creates an effective mean field in which a given fermion moves, in addition to the external potential $\\hat{u}_{\\mathrm{ext}}$ which confines the motion of the fermion. For systems like nuclei, there is no external confining potential. Nuclei are examples of self-bound systems, where the binding arises due to the intrinsic nature of the strong force. For nuclear systems thus, there would be no external one-body potential in the Hartree-Fock Hamiltonian.\n",
