      "* Tuesday:\n",
      "\n",
      " * Presentation of topics to be covered and introduction to nuclear structure physics\n",
      "\n",
      " * Discussion of quantities like binding energies, masses, radii, separation energies, see chapters 1-4 of Alex Brown's (AB) 2011 lectures\n",
      "\n",
      " * Single-particle degrees of freedom, discussion of data\n",

      "\n",
      " * Single-particle degrees of freedom, discussion of data\n",

      "\n",
      "* Syllabus: Lecture notes, exercises and projects. Relevant chapters of Suhonen's text that cover parts of the material are chapters 3-9 and 11. Chapters 1-2 on angular momentum will be used as references for various derivations and only parts of these two chapters will be used. Alex Brown's lecture notes from 2011 can also be used, and the relevant chapters are 1-4, 6-29. Chapter 5 of Brown on angular momentum plays the same role as chapters 1-2 of Suhonen. \n",

      "major topics\n",
      "* Single  particle properties and mean-field models, lecture notes, JS chapters 3-5 and AB chapters 7-10 and 14\n",
      "\n",
      "* Nuclear forces, covered by lecture notes\n",
      "\n",
      "* The nuclear shell-model, lecture notes, JS chapter 8 and AB chapters 11-22.\n",
      "\n",
      "* Particle-hole excitations, random-phase approximation and pairing (and perhaps something on collective models), lecture notes and JS chapters 9 and 11.\n",
      "\n",
      "* Decays and one and two-body transition probabilities, lecture notes, JS chapters 6 and 7, AB chapters 23-29.\n",
      "\n",
      "To understand how these topics are linked will provide us with fundamental insights about the laws of motion that govern nuclear physics.\n",

      "### Plan for the semester\n",
      "**Projects, weekly exercises, deadlines and final oral exam.**\n",
      "\n",
      "* One  project with a possible numerical content that counts 30%, weekly exercises  that count 30% and a final oral exam which counts 40\\% of the final grade. \n",
      "\n",
      "* Project 1 will be available mid February and to be handed in before spring break (exact dates to be determined)\n",
      "\n",
      "* For the final oral exam (after spring break, time to be determined) you have to prepare a 25-30 minutes talk based on either a topic chosen by you or a topic defined towards the end of the semester.\n",
      "\n",
      "Duration of the examination is 45 minutes. The remaining 15-20 minutes are for questions from other topics as well.\n",
