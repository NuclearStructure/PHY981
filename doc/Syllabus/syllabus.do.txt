TITLE: PHY 981 Nuclear Structure,  Syllabus/achievement requirements 
AUTHOR: National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory and Department of Physics and Astronomy, Michigan State University
DATE: Spring 2016


===== Basic Syllabus =====
* Syllabus: Lecture notes, exercises and projects. Relevant chapters of Suhonen's text that cover parts of the material are chapters 3-9 and 11. Chapters 1-2 on angular momentum will be used as references for various derivations and only parts of these two chapters will be used. Alex Brown's lecture notes from 2011 can also be used, and the relevant chapters are 1-4, 6-29. Chapter 5 of Brown on angular momentum plays the same role as chapters 1-2 of Suhonen. 

===== Main themes and reading suggestions =====
The various observables we will discuss in the course are thought to be understood via the following five major topics
* Single  particle properties and mean-field models, lecture notes, Suhonen chapters 3-5 and Brown chapters 7-10 and 14
* Nuclear forces, covered by lecture notes
* The nuclear shell-model, lecture notes, Suhonen chapter 8 and Brown chapters 11-22.
* Decays and one and two-body transition probabilities, lecture notes, Suhonen chapters 6 and 7, Brown chapters 23-29.
* If time allows, Particle-hole excitations, random-phase approximation and pairing (and perhaps something on collective models), lecture notes and Suhonen chapters 9 and 11.


===== Links to all course material =====
* PHY981 on github
 * All material is at  URL: "https://github.com/NuclearStructure/PHY981/"
 * The link URL: "http://nuclearstructure.github.io/PHY981/doc/web/course.html" gives direct access to html, ipython notebooks and pdf files of the lectures.




===== Projects, exercises and final oral exam =====
!bblock Projects, weekly exercises, deadlines and final oral exam
* Two  projects with a possible numerical content that count 25% each of the final mark, weekly exercises  that count 20% and a final oral exam which counts 30% of the final grade. 
* Project 1 will be available in week 6 (begins with February 8) and to be handed in before spring break (March 4)
* Project 2 will be available in week 13 (begins with March 28) with deadline April 18.
* For the final oral exam you have to prepare a 25-30 minutes talk based on either a topic chosen by you or a topic defined towards the end of the semester.
Duration of the examination is 45 minutes.

===== Links and useful software =====
* Useful links
 * When I write code in C++ I tend to recommend to use the linear algebra library "armadillo":"http://arma.sourceforge.net/". 
 * For OS X users I recommend using "brew":"http://brew.sh/".
 * To set up github, use the "guides":"https://guides.github.com/" and/or the github "link":"https://github.com/". 
 * An excellent IDE for c++ programmers is "Qt Creator":"http://www.qt.io/ide/"
