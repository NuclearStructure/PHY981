===== Slater determinants as basis states, Repetition =====
!bblock
The simplest possible choice for many-body wavefunctions are _product_ wavefunctions.
That is
!bt
\[ 
\Psi(x_1, x_2, x_3, \ldots, x_A) \approx \phi_1(x_1) \phi_2(x_2) \phi_3(x_3) \ldots
\]
!et
because we are really only good  at thinking about one particle at a time. Such 
product wavefunctions, without correlations, are easy to 
work with; for example, if the single-particle states $\phi_i(x)$ are orthonormal, then 
the product wavefunctions are easy to orthonormalize.   

Similarly, computing matrix elements of operators are relatively easy, because the 
integrals factorize.


The price we pay is the lack of correlations, which we must build up by using many, many product 
wavefunctions. (Thus we have a trade-off: compact representation of correlations but 
difficult integrals versus easy integrals but many states required.)

===== Slater determinants as basis states, repetition =====
!bblock
Because we have fermions, we are required to have antisymmetric wavefunctions, e.g.
!bt
\[
\Psi(x_1, x_2, x_3, \ldots, x_A) = - \Psi(x_2, x_1, x_3, \ldots, x_A)
\]
!et
etc. This is accomplished formally by using the determinantal formalism
!bt
\[
\Psi(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_A) 
= \frac{1}{\sqrt{A!}} 
\det \left | 
\begin{array}{cccc}
\phi_1(x_1) & \phi_1(x_2) & \ldots & \phi_1(x_A) \\
\phi_2(x_1) & \phi_2(x_2) & \ldots & \phi_2(x_A) \\
 \vdots & & &  \\
\phi_A(x_1) & \phi_A(x_2) & \ldots & \phi_A(x_A) 
\end{array}
\right |
\]
!et
Product wavefunction + antisymmetry = Slater determinant.

 \vdots & & &  \\
\phi_A(x_1) & \phi_A(x_2) & \ldots & \phi_A(x_A) 
\end{array}
\right |

Properties of the determinant (interchange of any two rows or 
any two columns yields a change in sign; thus no two rows and no 
two columns can be the same) lead to the Pauli principle:

* No two particles can be at the same place (two columns the same); and
* No two particles can be in the same state (two rows the same).

===== Slater determinants as basis states =====
!bblock
As a practical matter, however, Slater determinants beyond $N=4$ quickly become 
unwieldy. Thus we turn to the _occupation representation_ or _second quantization_ to simplify calculations. 

The occupation representation, using fermion _creation_ and _annihilation_ 
operators, is compact and efficient. It is also abstract and, at first encounter, not easy to 
internalize. It is inspired by other operator formalism, such as the ladder operators for 
the harmonic oscillator or for angular momentum, but unlike those cases, the operators _do not have coordinate space representations_.

Instead, one can think of fermion creation/annihilation operators as a game of symbols that 
compactly reproduces what one would do, albeit clumsily, with full coordinate-space Slater 
determinants. 
!eblock

!split
===== Quick repetition of the occupation representation =====
!bblock
We start with a set of orthonormal single-particle states $\{ \phi_i(x) \}$. 
(Note: this requirement, and others, can be relaxed, but leads to a 
more involved formalism.) _Any_ orthonormal set will do. 

To each single-particle state $\phi_i(x)$ we associate a creation operator 
$\hat{a}^\dagger_i$ and an annihilation operator $\hat{a}_i$. 

When acting on the vacuum state $| 0 \rangle$, the creation operator $\hat{a}^\dagger_i$ causes 
a particle to occupy the single-particle state $\phi_i(x)$:
!bt
\[
\phi_i(x) \rightarrow \hat{a}^\dagger_i |0 \rangle
\]
!et
!eblock

!split
===== Quick repetition  of the occupation representation =====
!bblock
But with multiple creation operators we can occupy multiple states:
!bt
\[
\phi_i(x) \phi_j(x^\prime) \phi_k(x^{\prime \prime}) 
\rightarrow \hat{a}^\dagger_i \hat{a}^\dagger_j \hat{a}^\dagger_k |0 \rangle.
\]
!et

Now we impose antisymmetry, by having the fermion operators satisfy  _anticommutation relations_:
!bt
\[
\hat{a}^\dagger_i \hat{a}^\dagger_j + \hat{a}^\dagger_j \hat{a}^\dagger_i
= [ \hat{a}^\dagger_i ,\hat{a}^\dagger_j ]_+ 
= \{ \hat{a}^\dagger_i ,\hat{a}^\dagger_j \} = 0
\]
!et
so that 
!bt
\[
\hat{a}^\dagger_i \hat{a}^\dagger_j = - \hat{a}^\dagger_j \hat{a}^\dagger_i
\]
!et
!eblock


!split
===== Quick repetition  of the occupation representation =====
!bblock
Because of this property, automatically $\hat{a}^\dagger_i \hat{a}^\dagger_i = 0$, 
enforcing the Pauli exclusion principle.  Thus when writing a Slater determinant 
using creation operators, 
!bt
\[
\hat{a}^\dagger_i \hat{a}^\dagger_j \hat{a}^\dagger_k \ldots |0 \rangle
\]
!et
each index $i,j,k, \ldots$ must be unique.

===== Full Configuration Interaction Theory =====
!bblock
We have defined the ansatz for the ground state as 
!bt
\[
|\Phi_0\rangle = \left(\prod_{i\le F}\hat{a}_{i}^{\dagger}\right)|0\rangle,
\]
!et
where the index $i$ defines different single-particle states up to the Fermi level. We have assumed that we have $N$ fermions. 
A given one-particle-one-hole ($1p1h$) state can be written as
!bt
\[
|\Phi_i^a\rangle = \hat{a}_{a}^{\dagger}\hat{a}_i|\Phi_0\rangle,
\]
!et
while a $2p2h$ state can be written as
!bt
\[
|\Phi_{ij}^{ab}\rangle = \hat{a}_{a}^{\dagger}\hat{a}_{b}^{\dagger}\hat{a}_j\hat{a}_i|\Phi_0\rangle,
\]
!et
and a general $NpNh$ state as 
!bt
\[
|\Phi_{ijk\dots}^{abc\dots}\rangle = \hat{a}_{a}^{\dagger}\hat{a}_{b}^{\dagger}\hat{a}_{c}^{\dagger}\dots\hat{a}_k\hat{a}_j\hat{a}_i|\Phi_0\rangle.
\]
!et
!eblock

!split
===== Full Configuration Interaction Theory =====
!bblock
We can then expand our exact state function for the ground state 
as
!bt
\[
|\Psi_0\rangle=C_0|\Phi_0\rangle+\sum_{ai}C_i^a|\Phi_i^a\rangle+\sum_{abij}C_{ij}^{ab}|\Phi_{ij}^{ab}\rangle+\dots
=(C_0+\hat{C})|\Phi_0\rangle,
\]
!et
where we have introduced the so-called correlation operator 
!bt
\[
\hat{C}=\sum_{ai}C_i^a\hat{a}_{a}^{\dagger}\hat{a}_i  +\sum_{abij}C_{ij}^{ab}\hat{a}_{a}^{\dagger}\hat{a}_{b}^{\dagger}\hat{a}_j\hat{a}_i+\dots
\]
!et
Since the normalization of $\Psi_0$ is at our disposal and since $C_0$ is by hypothesis non-zero, we may arbitrarily set $C_0=1$ with 
corresponding proportional changes in all other coefficients. Using this so-called intermediate normalization we have
!bt
\[
\langle \Psi_0 | \Phi_0 \rangle = \langle \Phi_0 | \Phi_0 \rangle = 1, 
\]
!et
resulting in 
!bt
\[
|\Psi_0\rangle=(1+\hat{C})|\Phi_0\rangle.
\]
!et
!eblock

!split
===== Full Configuration Interaction Theory =====
!bblock
We rewrite 
!bt
\[
|\Psi_0\rangle=C_0|\Phi_0\rangle+\sum_{ai}C_i^a|\Phi_i^a\rangle+\sum_{abij}C_{ij}^{ab}|\Phi_{ij}^{ab}\rangle+\dots,
\]
!et
in a more compact form as 
!bt
\[
|\Psi_0\rangle=\sum_{PH}C_H^P\Phi_H^P=\left(\sum_{PH}C_H^P\hat{A}_H^P\right)|\Phi_0\rangle,
\]
!et
where $H$ stands for $0,1,\dots,n$ hole states and $P$ for $0,1,\dots,n$ particle states. 
Our requirement of unit normalization gives
!bt
\[
\langle \Psi_0 | \Phi_0 \rangle = \sum_{PH}|C_H^P|^2= 1,
\]
!et
and the energy can be written as 
!bt
\[
E= \langle \Psi_0 | \hat{H} |\Phi_0 \rangle= \sum_{PP'HH'}C_H^{*P}\langle \Phi_H^P | \hat{H} |\Phi_{H'}^{P'} \rangle C_{H'}^{P'}.
\]
!et
!eblock

!split
===== Full Configuration Interaction Theory =====
!bblock
Normally 
!bt
\[
E= \langle \Psi_0 | \hat{H} |\Phi_0 \rangle= \sum_{PP'HH'}C_H^{*P}\langle \Phi_H^P | \hat{H} |\Phi_{H'}^{P'} \rangle C_{H'}^{P'},

!et
is solved by diagonalization setting up the Hamiltonian matrix defined by the basis of all possible Slater determinants. A diagonalization
# to do: add text about Rayleigh-Ritz
is equivalent to finding the variational minimum   of 
!bt
\[
 \langle \Psi_0 | \hat{H} |\Phi_0 \rangle-\lambda \langle \Psi_0 |\Phi_0 \rangle,
\]
!et
where $\lambda$ is a variational multiplier to be identified with the energy of the system.
The minimization process results in 
!bt
\[
\delta\left[ \langle \Psi_0 | \hat{H} |\Phi_0 \rangle-\lambda \langle \Psi_0 |\Phi_0 \rangle\right]=
\]
!et
!bt
\[
\sum_{P'H'}\left\{\delta[C_H^{*P}]\langle \Phi_H^P | \hat{H} |\Phi_{H'}^{P'} \rangle C_{H'}^{P'}+
C_H^{*P}\langle \Phi_H^P | \hat{H} |\Phi_{H'}^{P'} \rangle \delta[C_{H'}^{P'}]-
\lambda( \delta[C_H^{*P}]C_{H'}^{P'}+C_H^{*P}\delta[C_{H'}^{P'}]\right\} = 0.
\]
!et
Since the coefficients $\delta[C_H^{*P}]$ and $\delta[C_{H'}^{P'}]$ are complex conjugates it is necessary and sufficient to require the quantities that multiply with $\delta[C_H^{*P}]$ to vanish.

===== Full Configuration Interaction Theory =====
!bblock

This leads to 
!bt
\[
\sum_{P'H'}\langle \Phi_H^P | \hat{H} |\Phi_{H'}^{P'} \rangle C_{H'}^{P'}-\lambda C_H^{P}=0,
\]
!et
for all sets of $P$ and $H$.

If we then multiply by the corresponding $C_H^{*P}$ and sum over $PH$ we obtain
!bt
\[ 
\sum_{PP'HH'}C_H^{*P}\langle \Phi_H^P | \hat{H} |\Phi_{H'}^{P'} \rangle C_{H'}^{P'}-\lambda\sum_{PH}|C_H^P|^2=0,
\]
!et
leading to the identification $\lambda = E$. This means that we have for all $PH$ sets
!bt
\begin{equation}
\sum_{P'H'}\langle \Phi_H^P | \hat{H} -E|\Phi_{H'}^{P'} \rangle = 0. label{eq:fullci}
\end{equation}
!et
!eblock



!split
===== Full Configuration Interaction Theory =====
!bblock
An alternative way to derive the last equation is to start from 
!bt
\[
(\hat{H} -E)|\Psi_0\rangle = (\hat{H} -E)\sum_{P'H'}C_{H'}^{P'}|\Phi_{H'}^{P'} \rangle=0, 
\]
!et
and if this equation is successively projected against all $\Phi_H^P$ in the expansion of $\Psi$, then the last equation on the previous slide
results.   As stated previously, one solves this equation normally by diagonalization. If we are able to solve this equation exactly (that is
numerically exactly) in a large Hilbert space (it will be truncated in terms of the number of single-particle states included in the definition
of Slater determinants), it can then serve as a benchmark for other many-body methods which approximate the correlation operator
$\hat{C}$.

=====  Example of a Hamiltonian matrix =====
!bblock
Suppose, as an example, that we have six fermions below the Fermi level.
This means that we can make at most $6p-6h$ excitations. If we have an infinity of single particle states above the Fermi level, we will obviously have an infinity of say $2p-2h$ excitations. Each such way to configure the particles is called a _configuration_. We will always have to truncate in the basis of single-particle states.
This gives us a finite number of possible Slater determinants. Our Hamiltonian matrix would then look like (where each block can have a large dimensionalities):

|---------------------------------------------------------------|
|       |$0p-0h$ | $1p-1h$   | $2p-2h$ | $3p-3h$| $4p-4h$ | $5p-5h$ | $6p-6h$ |

=====  Shell-model jargon =====
!bblock
If we do not make any truncations in the possible sets of Slater determinants (many-body states) we can make by distributing $A$ nucleons among $n$ single-particle states, we call such a calculation for _Full configuration interaction theory_

If we make truncations, we have different possibilities

* The standard nuclear shell-model. Here we define an effective Hilbert space with respect to a given core. The calculations are normally then performed for all many-body states that can be constructed from the effective Hilbert spaces. This approach requires a properly defined effective Hamiltonian
* We can truncate in the number of excitations. For example, we can limit the possible Slater determinants to only $1p-1h$ and $2p-2h$ excitations. This is called a configuration interaction calculation at the level of singles and doubles excitations, or just CISD. 
* We can limit the number of excitations in terms of the excitation energies. If we do not define a core, this defines normally what is called the no-core shell-model approach. 

What happens if we have a three-body interaction and a Hartree-Fock basis? 
!eblock

!split
=====  FCI and the exponential growth =====
!bblock
Full configuration interaction theory calculations provide in principle, if we can diagonalize numerically, all states of interest. The dimensionality of the problem explodes however quickly.

The total number of Slater determinants which can be built with say $N$ neutrons distributed among $n$ single particle states is
!bt
\[
\left (\begin{array}{c} n \\ N\end{array} \right) =\frac{n!}{(n-N)!N!}. 
\]
!et

For a model space which comprises the first for major shells only $0s$, $0p$, $1s0d$ and $1p0f$ we have $40$ single particle states for neutrons and protons.  For the eight neutrons of oxygen-16 we would then have
!bt
\[
\left (\begin{array}{c} 40 \\ 8\end{array} \right) =\frac{40!}{(32)!8!}\sim 10^{9}, 
\]
!et
and multiplying this with the number of proton Slater determinants we end up with approximately witha dimensionality $d$ of $d\sim 10^{18}$.
!eblock


!split
=====  Exponential wall =====
!bblock
This number can be reduced if we look at specific symmetries only. However, the dimensionality explodes quickly!

* For Hamiltonian matrices of dimensionalities  which are smaller than $d\sim 10^5$, we would use so-called direct methods for diagonalizing the Hamiltonian matrix
* For larger dimensionalities iterative eigenvalue solvers like Lanczos' method are used. The most efficient codes at present can handle matrices of $d\sim 10^{10}$.

In our notes on Hartree-Fock calculations, 
we have already computed the matrix $\langle \Phi_0 | \hat{H}|\Phi_{i}^{a}\rangle $ and $\langle \Phi_0 | \hat{H}|\Phi_{ij}^{ab}\rangle$.  If we are using a Hartree-Fock basis, then the matrix elements

For $C_{jk}^{bc}$ we need then

This is a very cumbersome way of solving the equation. However, by using this iterative scheme we can illustrate how we can compute the
various terms in the wave operator or correlation operator $\hat{C}$. We will later identify the calculation of the various terms $C_H^P$
as parts of different many-body approximations to full CI. In particular, we can  relate this non-linear scheme with Coupled Cluster theory and
many-body perturbation theory.

If we can diagonalize large matrices, FCI is the method of choice since:
* It gives all eigenvalues, ground state and excited states
* The eigenvectors are obtained directly from the coefficients $C_H^P$ which result from the diagonalization
* We can compute easily expectation values of other operators, as well as transition probabilities
* Correlations are easy to understand in terms of contributions to a given operator beyond the Hartree-Fock contribution. This is the standard approach in  many-body theory.

The coefficients $C$ result from the solution of the eigenvalue problem. 
The energy of say the ground state is then

===== FCI equation and the coefficients  =====

However, as we have seen, even for a small case like the four first major shells and a nucleus like oxygen-16, the dimensionality becomes quickly intractable. If we wish to include single-particle states that reflect weakly bound systems, we need a much larger single-particle basis. We need thus approximative methods that sum specific correlations to infinite order. 

Popular methods are
* "Many-body perturbation theory (in essence a Taylor expansion)":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0370157395000126"
* "Coupled cluster theory (coupled non-linear equations)":"http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0034-4885/77/9/096302/meta"
* Green's function approaches (matrix inversion)
* "Similarity group transformation methods (coupled ordinary differential equations)":"http://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.106.222502"

All these methods start normally with a Hartree-Fock basis as the calculational basis.

===== Building a many-body basis =====
!bblock
An important step in an FCI code  is to construct the many-body basis.  

While the formalism is independent of the choice of basis, the _effectiveness_ of a calculation 
will certainly be basis dependent. 

Furthermore there are common conventions useful to know.

First, the single-particle basis has angular momentum as a good quantum number.  You can 
imagine the single-particle wavefunctions being generated by a one-body Hamiltonian, 
for example a harmonic oscillator.  Modifications include harmonic oscillator plus 
spin-orbit splitting, or self-consistent mean-field potentials, or the Woods-Saxon potential which mocks 
up the self-consistent mean-field. 
For nuclei, the harmonic oscillator, modified by spin-orbit splitting, provides a useful language 
for describing single-particle states.
!eblock

!split
===== Building a many-body basis =====
!bblock
Each single-particle state is labeled by the following quantum numbers: 

* Orbital angular momentum $l$

* Intrinsic spin $s$ = 1/2 for protons and neutrons

* Angular momentum $j = l \pm 1/2$

* $z$-component $j_z$ (or $m$)

* Some labeling of the radial wavefunction, typically $n$ the number of nodes in  the radial wavefunction, but in the case of harmonic oscillator one can also use the principal quantum number $N$, where the harmonic oscillator energy is $(N+3/2)\hbar \omega$.  


In this format one labels states by $n(l)_j$, with $(l)$ replaced by a letter:
$s$ for $l=0$, $p$ for $l=1$, $d$ for $l=2$, $f$ for $l=3$, and thenceforth alphabetical.
!eblock

!split
===== Building a many-body basis =====
!bblock
 In practice the single-particle space has to be severely truncated.  This truncation is 
typically based upon the single-particle energies, which is the effective energy 
from a mean-field potential. 

Sometimes we freeze the core and only consider a valence space. For example, one 
may assume a frozen ${}^{4}\mbox{He}$ core, with two protons and two neutrons in the $0s_{1/2}$ 
shell, and then only allow active particles in the $0p_{1/2}$ and $0p_{3/2}$ orbits. 


Another example is a frozen ${}^{16}\mbox{O}$ core, with eight protons and eight neutrons filling the 
$0s_{1/2}$,  $0p_{1/2}$ and $0p_{3/2}$ orbits, with valence particles in the 
$0d_{5/2}, 1s_{1/2}$ and $0d_{3/2}$ orbits.


Sometimes we refer to nuclei by the valence space where their last nucleons go.  
So, for example, we call ${}^{12}\mbox{C}$ a $p$-shell nucleus, while ${}^{26}\mbox{Al}$ is an 
$sd$-shell nucleus and ${}^{56}\mbox{Fe}$ is a $pf$-shell nucleus.
!eblock

===== Building a many-body basis =====
!bblock
There are different kinds of truncations.

* For example, one can start with `filled' orbits (almost always the lowest), and then  allow one, two, three... particles excited out of those filled orbits. These are called  1p-1h, 2p-2h, 3p-3h excitations. 

* Alternately, one can state a maximal orbit and allow all possible configurations with  particles occupying states up to that maximum. This is called *full configuration*.

* Finally, for particular use in nuclear physics, there is the *energy* truncation, also  called the $N\hbar\Omega$ or $N_{max}$ truncation. 
!eblock

!split
===== Building a many-body basis =====
!bblock
Here one works in a harmonic oscillator basis, with each major oscillator shell assigned  a principal quantum number $N=0,1,2,3,...$. 
The $N\hbar\Omega$ or $N_{max}$ truncation: Any configuration is given an noninteracting energy, which is the sum 
of the single-particle harmonic oscillator energies. (Thus this ignores 
spin-orbit splitting.)

Excited state are labeled relative to the lowest configuration by the 
number of harmonic oscillator quanta.

This truncation is useful because if one includes *all* configuration up to 
some $N_{max}$, and has a translationally invariant interaction, then the intrinsic 
motion and the center-of-mass motion factor. In other words, we can know exactly 
the center-of-mass wavefunction. 

In almost all cases, the many-body Hamiltonian is rotationally invariant. This means 
it commutes with the operators $\hat{J}^2, \hat{J}_z$ and so eigenstates will have 
good $J,M$. Furthermore, the eigenenergies do not depend upon the orientation $M$. 


Therefore we can choose to construct a many-body basis which has fixed $M$; this is 
called an $M$-scheme basis. 


Alternately, one can construct a many-body basis which has fixed $J$, or a $J$-scheme 
basis. 
!eblock

!split
===== Building a many-body basis =====
!bblock
The Hamiltonian matrix will have smaller dimensions (a factor of 10 or more) in the $J$-scheme than in the $M$-scheme. 
On the other hand, as we'll show in the next slide, the $M$-scheme is very easy to 
construct with Slater determinants, while the $J$-scheme basis states, and thus the 
matrix elements, are more complicated, almost always being linear combinations of 
$M$-scheme states. $J$-scheme bases are important and useful, but we'll focus on the 
simpler $M$-scheme.

The quantum number $m$ is additive (because the underlying group is Abelian): 
if a Slater determinant $\hat{a}_i^\dagger \hat{a}^\dagger_j \hat{a}^\dagger_k \ldots | 0 \rangle$ 
is built from single-particle states all with good $m$, then the total 
!bt
\[
M = m_i + m_j + m_k + \ldots
\]
!et
This is *not* true of $J$, because the angular momentum group SU(2) is not Abelian.

!eblock


!split
===== Building a many-body basis =====

The upshot is that 
* It is easy to construct a Slater determinant with good total $M$;

* It is trivial to calculate $M$ for each Slater determinant;

* So it is easy to construct an $M$-scheme basis with fixed total $M$.

Note that the individual $M$-scheme basis states will *not*, in general, 
have good total $J$. 
Because the Hamiltonian is rotationally invariant, however, the eigenstates will 
have good $J$. (The situation is muddied when one has states of different $J$ that are 
nonetheless degenerate.)

The basic goal of this project is for you to build your own configuration-interaction  shell-model 
code. The code will be fairly basic; it will assume that we have 
a single species of particles, e.g. only neutrons, 
and you could, if you wish to,  read in uncoupled two-body matrix elements.  Furthermore the pieces of the code will not 
be the most efficient.  Nonetheless it will be usable; most importantly, you will gain a good idea of what goes into a many-body shell-model code.

The first step  is to construct the $M$-scheme basis of Slater determinants.
Here $M$-scheme means the total $J_z$ of the many-body states is fixed.

The steps could be:

* Read in a user-supplied file of single-particle states (examples can be given) or just code these internally;

* Ask for the total $M$ of the system and the number of particles $N$;

* Construct all the $N$-particle states with given $M$.  You will validate the code by  comparing both the number of states and specific states.

|----------------------------------------------|

This represents the $1s_{1/2}0d_{3/2}0d_{5/2}$ valence space, or just the $sd$-space.  There are 
twelve single-particle states, labeled by an overall index, and which have associated quantum 
numbers the number of radial nodes, the orbital angular momentum $l$, and the 
angular momentum $j$ and third component $j_z$.  To keep everything as integers, we could store $2 \times j$ and 
$2 \times j_z$. 
!eblock

!split
===== Shell-model project  =====
!bblock
To read in the single-particle states you need to:
* Open the file 

*  Read the number of single-particle states (in the above example, 12);  allocate memory; all you need is a single array storing $2\times j_z$ for each state, labeled by the index.

* Read in the quantum numbers and store $2 \times j_z$ (and anything else you happen to want).
!eblock

!split
===== Shell-model project  =====
!bblock

The next step is to read in the number of particles $N$ and the fixed total $M$ (or, actually, $2 \times M$). 
For this project we assume only a single species of particles, say neutrons, although this can be 
relaxed. _Note_: Although it is often a good idea to try to write a more general code, given the 
short time alloted we would suggest you keep your ambition in check, at least in the initial phases of the 
project.  


You should probably write an error trap to make sure $N$ and $M$ are congruent; if $N$ is even, then 
$2 \times M$ should be even, and if $N$ is odd then $2\times M$ should be odd. 
!eblock

!split
===== Shell-model project  =====
!bblock
The final step is to generate the set of $N$-particle Slater determinants with fixed $M$. 
The Slater determinants will be stored in occupation representation.  Although in many codes
this representation is done compactly in bit notation with ones and zeros, but for 
greater transparency and simplicity we will list the occupied single particle states.

 Hence we can 
store the Slater determinant basis states as $sd(i,j)$, that is an 
array of dimension $N_{SD}$, the number of Slater determinants, by $N$, the number of occupied 
state. So if for the 7th Slater determinant the 2nd, 3rd, and 9th single-particle states are occupied, 
then $sd(7,1) = 2$, $sd(7,2) = 3$, and $sd(7,3) = 9$.
!eblock

!split
===== Shell-model project  =====
!bblock

We can construct an occupation representation of Slater determinants by the *odometer*
method.  Consider $N_{sp} = 12$ and $N=4$. 
Start with the first 4 states occupied, that is:

* $sd(1,:)= 1,2,3,4$ (also written as $|1,2,3,4 \rangle$)
Now increase the last occupancy recursively:
* $sd(2,:)= 1,2,3,5$
* $sd(3,:)= 1,2,3,6$
* $sd(4,:)= 1,2,3,7$
* $\ldots$
* $sd(9,:)= 1,2,3,12$

Then start over with 
* $sd(10,:)= 1,2,4,5$
and again increase the rightmost digit

* $sd(11,:)= 1,2,4,6$
* $sd(12,:)= 1,2,4,7$
* $\ldots$
* $sd(17,:)= 1,2,4,12$

When we restrict ourselves to an $M$-scheme basis, we could choose two paths. 
The first is simplest (and simplest is often best, at 
least in the first draft of a code): generate all possible Slater determinants, 
and then extract from this initial list a list of those Slater determinants with a given 
$M$. (You will need to write a short function or routine that computes $M$ for any 
given occupation.)  


Alternately, and not too difficult, is to run the odometer routine twice: each time, as 
as a Slater determinant is calculated, compute $M$, but do not store the Slater determinants 
except the current one. You can then count up the number of Slater determinants with a 
chosen $M$.  Then allocated storage for the Slater determinants, and run the odometer 
algorithm again, this time storing Slater determinants with the desired $M$ (this can be 
done with a simple logical flag).

* Write small modules (routines/functions) ; avoid big functions  that do everything. (But not too small.)
* Write lots of error traps, even for things that are `obvious.'
* Document as you go along.  For each function write a header that includes: 
 o Main purpose of function
 o names and  brief explanation of input variables, if any 
 o names and brief explanation of output variables, if any
 o functions called by this function
 o called by which functions

Hints for coding

* When debugging, print out intermediate values. It's almost impossible to debug a  code by looking at it--the code will almost always win a `staring contest.'

* Validate code with SIMPLE CASES. Validate early and often.   


The number one mistake is using a too complex a system to test. For example ,
if you are computing particles in a potential in a box, try removing the potential--you should get 
particles in a box. And start with one particle, then two, then three... Don't start with 
eight particles.

Our recommended occupation representation, e.g. $| 1,2,4,8 \rangle$, is 
easy to code, but numerically inefficient when one has hundreds of 
millions of Slater determinants.


In state-of-the-art shell-model codes, one generally uses bit 
representation, i.e. $|1101000100... \rangle$ where one stores 
the Slater determinant as a single (or a small number of) integer.


This is much more compact, but more intricate to code with considerable 
more overhead. There exist 
bit-manipulation functions. 
This is left as a challenge for those of you who would like to study this topic further for the final project to be presented for the oral examination.

===== Example case: pairing Hamiltonian =====
!bblock

We consider a space with $2\Omega$ single-particle states, with each 
state labeled by 
$k = 1, 2, 3, \Omega$ and $m = \pm 1/2$. The convention is that 
the state with $k>0$ has $m = + 1/2$ while $-k$ has $m = -1/2$.


The Hamiltonian we consider is 
!bt
\[
\hat{H} = -G \hat{P}_+ \hat{P}_-,
\]
!et
where
!bt
\[
\hat{P}_+ = \sum_{k > 0} \hat{a}^\dagger_k \hat{a}^\dagger_{-{k}}.
\]
!et
and $\hat{P}_- = ( \hat{P}_+)^\dagger$.

This problem can be solved using what is called the quasi-spin formalism to obtain the 
exact results. Thereafter we will try again using the explicit Slater determinant formalism.

===== Example case: pairing Hamiltonian =====
!bblock

One can show (and this is part of the project) that
!bt
\[
\left [ \hat{P}_+, \hat{P}_- \right ] = \sum_{k> 0} \left( \hat{a}^\dagger_k \hat{a}_k 
+ \hat{a}^\dagger_{-{k}} \hat{a}_{-{k}} - 1 \right) = \hat{N} - \Omega.
\]
!et
Now define 
!bt
\[
\hat{P}_z = \frac{1}{2} ( \hat{N} -\Omega).
\]
!et
Finally you can show
!bt
\[
\left [ \hat{P}_z , \hat{P}_\pm \right ] = \pm \hat{P}_\pm.
\]
!et
This means the operators $\hat{P}_\pm, \hat{P}_z$ form a so-called  $SU(2)$ algebra, and we can 
use all our insights about angular momentum, even though there is no actual 
angular momentum involved (this is similar to project 1).

So we rewrite the Hamiltonian to make this explicit:
!bt
\[
\hat{H} = -G \hat{P}_+ \hat{P}_- 
= -G \left( \hat{P}^2 - \hat{P}_z^2 + \hat{P}_z\right)
\]
!et

!eblock

!split
===== Example case: pairing Hamiltonian =====
!bblock

Because of the SU(2) algebra, we know that the eigenvalues of 
$\hat{P}^2$ must be of the form $p(p+1)$, with $p$ either integer or half-integer, and the eigenvalues of $\hat{P}_z$ 
are $m_p$ with $p \geq | m_p|$, with $m_p$ also integer or half-integer. 


But because $\hat{P}_z = (1/2)(\hat{N}-\Omega)$, we know that for $N$ particles 
the value $m_p = (N-\Omega)/2$. Furthermore, the values of $m_p$ range from 
$-\Omega/2$ (for $N=0$) to $+\Omega/2$ (for $N=2\Omega$, with all states filled). 

We deduce the maximal $p = \Omega/2$ and for a given $n$ the 
values range of $p$ range from $|N-\Omega|/2$ to $\Omega/2$ in steps of 1 
(for an even number of particles) 


Following Racah we introduce the notation
$p = (\Omega - v)/2$
where $v = 0, 2, 4,..., \Omega - |N-\Omega|$ 
With this it is easy to deduce that the eigenvalues of the pairing Hamiltonian are
!bt
\[
-G(N-v)(2\Omega +2-N-v)/4
\]
!et
This also works for $N$ odd, with $v= 1,3,5, \dots$.

===== Example case: pairing Hamiltonian =====

Let's take a specific example: $\Omega = 3$ so there are 6 single-particle states, 
and $N = 3$, with $v= 1,3$. Therefore there are two distinct eigenvalues, 
!bt
\[
E = -2G, 0
\]
!et
Now let's work this out explicitly. The single particle degrees of freedom are defined as

|----------------------------------------|
|Index | $k$   | $m$                     | 
|----------------------------------------|
| 1 | 1 | -1/2   | 
| 2 | -1 | 1/2 |
| 3 | 2 | -1/2  |
| 4 | -2 | 1/2 |
| 5 | 3 | -1/2 |
| 6 | -3 | 1/2 |
|----------------------------------------|

 There are  $\left( \begin{array}{c}6 \\ 3 \end{array} \right) = 20$ three-particle states, but there 
are 9 states with $M = +1/2$, namely
$| 1,2,3 \rangle, |1,2,5\rangle, | 1,4,6 \rangle, | 2,3,4 \rangle, |2,3,6 \rangle, | 2,4,5 \rangle, | 2, 5, 6 \rangle, |3,4,6 \rangle, | 4,5,6 \rangle$.

In this basis, the operator 
!bt
\[
\hat{P}_+
= \hat{a}^\dagger_1 \hat{a}^\dagger_2 + \hat{a}^\dagger_3 \hat{a}^\dagger_4 +
\hat{a}^\dagger_5 \hat{a}^\dagger_6 
\]
!et
From this we can determine that 
!bt
\[
\hat{P}_- | 1, 4, 6 \rangle = \hat{P}_- | 2, 3, 6 \rangle
= \hat{P}_- | 2, 4, 5 \rangle = 0
\]
!et
so those states all have eigenvalue 0.
!eblock


!split
===== Example case: pairing Hamiltonian =====

Now for further example, 
!bt
\[
\hat{P}_- | 1,2,3 \rangle = | 3 \rangle
\]
!et
so
!bt
\[
\hat{P}_+ \hat{P}_- | 1,2,3\rangle = | 1,2,3\rangle+ | 3,4,3\rangle + | 5,6,3\rangle
\]
!et
The second term vanishes because state 3 is occupied twice, and reordering the last 
term we
get
!bt
\[
\hat{P}_+ \hat{P}_- | 1,2,3\rangle = | 1,2,3\rangle+ |3, 5,6\rangle
\]

without picking up a phase.

Continuing in this fashion, with the previous ordering of the many-body states
(  $| 1,2,3 \rangle, |1,2,5\rangle, | 1,4,6 \rangle, | 2,3,4 \rangle, |2,3,6 \rangle, | 2,4,5 \rangle, | 2, 5, 6 \rangle, |3,4,6 \rangle, | 4,5,6 \rangle$) the 
Hamiltonian matrix of this system is 
!bt
\[
H = -G\left( 
\begin{array}{ccccccccc}
1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1  \\
0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0  \\

1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1

This is useful for our project.  One can by hand confirm 
that there are 3 eigenvalues $-2G$ and 6 with value zero.

|8  |   3  |   0   |   1/2   |   1/2    |
|----------------------------------------|

and then taking only 4-particle, $M=0$ states that have no `broken pairs', there are six basis Slater 
determinants:

* $|           1,           2 ,          3         ,       4  \rangle , $

We can write down the $ 6 \times 6$  Hamiltonian in the basis from the prior slide:

For $\delta = 0$ we have the closed form solution of  the g.s. energy given by $-6G$.

where $\alpha, \beta$ are indices labeling Slater determinants and $p,q,r,s$ label

===== Building a Hamiltonian matrix =====
!bblock
Note: there are other, more efficient ways to do this than the method we describe, 
but you will
be able to produce a working code quickly.

As we coded in the first step,
a Slater determinant $| \alpha \rangle$ with index $\alpha$ is a
list of $N$ occupied single-particle states $i_1 < i_2 < i_3 \ldots i_N$.


Furthermore, for the two-body matrix elements $V_{pqrs}$ we normally assume
$p < q$ and $r < s$. For our specific project, the interaction is much simpler and you can use this to simplify considerably the setup of a shell-model code for project 2.

What follows here is a more general, but still brute force, approach.

Write a function that:
o Has as input the single-particle indices $p,q,r,s$ for the two-body operator and the index $\alpha$ for the ket Slater determinant;

o Returns the index $\beta$ of the unique (if any) Slater determinant such that
!bt
\[
| \beta \rangle = \pm \hat{a}^\dagger_p \hat{a}^\dagger_q\hat{a}_s \hat{a}_r |\alpha \rangle
\]

as well as the phase

This is equivalent to computing

\[
\langle \beta | \hat{a}^\dagger_p \hat{a}^\dagger_q\hat{a}_s \hat{a}_r |\alpha \rangle
\]
!et

!split
===== Building a Hamiltonian matrix, first step =====
!bblock
The first step can take as input an initial Slater determinant
(whose position in the list of basis Slater determinants is $\alpha$) written as an
ordered listed of occupied single-particle states, e.g. $1,2,5,8$, and the
indices $p,q,r,s$ from the two-body operator. 

It will return another final Slater determinant if the single-particle states $r$ and $s$ are occupied, else it will return an 
empty Slater determinant
(all zeroes). 

If $r$ and $s$ are in the list of occupied single particle states, then
replace the initial single-particle states $ij$ as $i \rightarrow r$ and $j \rightarrow r$.


!eblock


!split
===== Building a Hamiltonian matrix, second step =====
!bblock
The second step will take the final Slater determinant 
from the first step (if not empty),
and then order by pairwise permutations (i.e., if the Slater determinant is
$i_1, i_2, i_3, \ldots$, then if $i_n > i_{n+1}$, interchange 
$i_n \leftrightarrow i_{n+1}$.


!eblock



!split
===== Building a Hamiltonian matrix =====
!bblock

It will also output a phase.  If any two single-particle occupancies are repeated, 
the phase is
0.  Otherwise it is +1 for an even permutation and -1 for an odd permutation to 
bring the final
Slater determinant into ascending order, $j_1 < j_2 < j_3 \ldots$.

_Example_: Suppose in the $sd$ single-particle space that the initial 
Slater determinant
is $1,3,9,12$. If $p,q,r,s = 2,8,1,12$, then after the first step the final Slater determinant
is $2,3,9,8$.  The second step will return $2,3,8,9$ and a phase of -1, 
because an odd number  of interchanges is required.

_Example_: Suppose in the $sd$ single-particle space that the initial 
Slater determinant
is $1,3,9,12$. If $p,q,r,s = 3,8,1,12$, then after the first step the 
final  Slater determinant
is $3,3,9,8$, but after the second step the phase is 0 
because the single-particle state 3 is
occupied twice.

Lastly, the final step  takes the ordered final Slater determinant and 
we search through the basis list to
determine its index in the many-body basis, that is, $\beta$.

o Initialize $H(\alpha,\beta)=0.0$
o Loop over $\alpha = 1, NSD$
o For each $\alpha$, loop over $a=1,ntbme$  and fetch $V(a)$ and the single-particle indices $p,q,r,s$ 
o If $V(a) = 0$ skip.  Otherwise, apply $\hat{a}^\dagger_p\hat{a}^\dagger_q \hat{a}_s \hat{a}_r$ to the Slater determinant labeled by $\alpha$.
o Find, if any, the label $\beta $ of the resulting Slater determinant and the phase (which is 0, +1, -1).
o If phase $\neq 0$, then update $H(\alpha,\beta)$  as $H(\alpha,\beta) + phase*V(a)$. The sum is important because multiple operators might contribute to the same matrix element.
o Continue loop over $a$
o Continue loop over $\alpha$.

You should force the resulting matrix $H$ to be symmetric. To do this, when
updating $H(\alpha,\beta)$, if $\alpha \neq \beta$, also update $H(\beta,\alpha)$.

You will also need to include the single-particle energies. This is easy: they only
