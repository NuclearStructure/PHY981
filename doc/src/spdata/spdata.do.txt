===== Stability of matter ===== 
!bblock 
To understand why matter is stable, and thereby shed light on the limits of 
nuclear stability, is one of the 
overarching aims and intellectual challenges 
of basic research in nuclear physics. To relate the stability of matter
to the underlying fundamental forces and particles of nature as manifested in nuclear matter, is central
to present and planned rare isotope facilities. 
Important properties of nuclear systems which can reveal information about these topics 
are for example masses, and thereby binding energies, and density distributions of nuclei.  
These are quantities which convey important information on 
the shell structure of nuclei, with their 
pertinent magic numbers and shell closures or the  eventual disappearence of the latter 
away from  the valley of stability.

!eblock

!split 
===== Drip lines ===== 
!bblock 

Neutron-rich nuclei are particularly interesting for the above endeavour. As a particular chain
of isotopes becomes more and more neutron rich, one reaches finally the limit of stability, the so-called
dripline, where one additional neutron makes the next isotopes unstable with respect 
to the previous ones. The appearence or not of magic numbers and shell structures,
the formation of neutron skins and halos
can thence be probed via investigations of quantities like  the binding energy
or the charge radii and neutron rms radii of neutron-rich nuclei. 
These quantities have in turn important 
consequences for theoretical models of nuclear structure and their application in astrophysics.

!bblock 


Neutron radius of ${}^{208}\mbox{Pb}$, recently extracted from the PREX 
experiment at Jefferson Laboratory  can be used to constrain the equation of state of 
neutron matter. A related quantity to the
neutron rms radius $r_n^{\mathrm{rms}}=\langle r^2\rangle_n^{1/2}$ is the neutron skin 
$r_{\mathrm{skin}}=r_n^{\mathrm{rms}}-r_p^{\mathrm{rms}}$,
where $r_p^{\mathrm{rms}}$ is the corresponding proton rms radius.  
There are several properties which relate the thickness of the neutron skin to quantities in nuclei and 
nuclear matter, such as the symmetry energy at the saturation point for nuclear matter, the slope
of the equation of state for neutron matter
or the low-energy electric dipole strength due to the pigmy dipole resonance.

===== Motivation ===== 
!bblock 
Having access to precise measurements of masses, radii, and
electromagnetic moments for a wide range of nuclei allows to study
trends with varying neutron excess. A quantitative description of
various experimental data with quantified uncertainty still remains a
major challenge for nuclear structure theory.  Global theoretical
studies of isotopic chains, such as the Ca chain shown in the figure below here, make it possible to test systematic
properties of effective interactions between nucleons. Such calculations also
provide critical tests of limitations of many-body methods. As one
approaches the particle emission thresholds, it becomes increasingly
important to describe correctly the coupling to the continuum of
decays and scattering channels. While the
full treatment of antisymmetrization and short-range correlations has
become routine in first principle  approaches (to be defined later) to nuclear bound states, the
many-body problem becomes more difficult when long-range correlations
and continuum effects are considered.

!split 
===== Motivation and aims ===== 
!bblock 

The aim of the first part of this course is to present some of the
experimental data which can be used to extract information about
correlations in nuclear systems. In particular, we will start with a
theoretical analysis of a quantity called the separation energy for
neutrons or protons. This quantity, to be discussed below, is defined
as the difference between two binding energies (masses) of neighboring
nuclei. As we will see from various figures below and exercises as
well, the separation energies display a varying behavior as function
of the number of neutrons or protons. These variations from one
nucleus to another one, laid the foundation for the introduction of
so-called magic numbers and a mean-field picture in order to describe
nuclei theoretically.

!eblock



!split 
===== Mean-field picture ===== 
!bblock 

With a mean- or average-field picture we mean that a given nucleon (either a proton or a neutron) moves in an average potential field which is set up by all other nucleons in the system. Consider for example a nucleus like ${}^{17}\mbox{O}$ with nine neutrons and eight protons. Many properties  of this nucleus can be interpreted in terms of a picture where we can view it as
one neutron on top of ${}^{16}\mbox{O}$. We infer from data and our theoretical interpretations that this additional neutron behaves almost as an individual neutron which *sees* an average interaction set up by the remaining 16 nucleons in   ${}^{16}\mbox{O}$. A nucleus like ${}^{16}\mbox{O}$ is an example of what we in this course will denote as a good closed-shell nucleus. We will come back to what this means later.


!eblock


!split 
===== Mean-field picture, which potential do we opt for?  ===== 
!bblock 


A simple potential model which enjoys quite some popularity in nuclear
physics, is the _three-dimensional harmonic oscillator_. This potential
model captures some of the physics of deeply bound single-particle
states but fails in reproducing the less bound single-particle
states. 

A parametrized, and more realistic, potential model which is
widely used in nuclear physics, is the so-called _Woods-Saxon_
potential. Both the harmonic oscillator and the Woods-Saxon potential
models define computational problems that can easily be solved (see
below), resulting (with the appropriate parameters) in a rather good
reproduction of experiment for nuclei which can be approximated as one
nucleon on top (or one nucleon removed) of a so-called closed-shell
system.

!eblock



!split 
===== Too simple? ===== 
!bblock 

To be able to interpret a nucleus in such a way requires at least that
we are capable of parametrizing the abovementioned interactions in
order to reproduce say the excitation spectrum of a nucleus like
${}^{17}\mbox{O}$.

With such a parametrized interaction we are able to solve
Schroedinger's equation for the motion of one nucleon in a given
field. A nucleus is however a true and complicated many-nucleon
system, with extremely many degrees of freedom and complicated
correlations, rendering the ideal solution of the many-nucleon
Schroedinger equation an impossible enterprise. It is much easier to
solve a single-particle problem with say a Woods-Saxon
potential. 

!eblock
!split 
===== Motivation, better mean-fields ===== 
!bblock 

An improvement to these simpler single-nucleon potentials is given by
the Hartree-Fock method, where the variational principle is used to
define a mean-field which the nucleons move in. There are many
different classes of mean-field methods.  An important difference
between these methods and the simpler parametrized mean-field
potentials like the harmonic oscillator and the Woods-Saxon
potentials, is that the resulting equations contain information about
the nuclear forces present in our models for solving Schroedinger's
equation. Hartree-Fock and other mean-field methods like density
functional theory form core topics in later lectures.

!eblock



!split 
===== Aims here ===== 
!bblock 

The aim here is to present some of the experimental data we
will confront theory with. In particular, we will focus on separation
and shell-gap energies and use these to build a picture of nuclei in
terms of (from a philosophical stand we would call this a reductionist
approach) a single-particle picture. The harmonic oscillator will
serve as an excellent starting point in building nuclei from the
bottom and up. Here we will neglect nuclear forces, these are
introduced in the next section when we discuss the Hartree-Fock
method.

The aim of this course is to develop our physics intuition of nuclear systems using  a theoretical approach  where we describe data in terms of 
the motion of individual nucleons and their mutual interactions. 

_How our theoretical pictures and models can be used to interpret data is in essence what this course is about_. Our narrative will lead us along a path where we start with single-particle models and end with the theory of the nuclear shell-model. The latter will be used to understand and analyze excitation spectra and decay patterns of nuclei, linking our theoretical understanding with interpretations of experiment. The way we build up our theoretical descriptions and interpretations follows what we may call a standard reductionistic approach, that is we start with what we believe are our effective degrees of freedom (nucleons in our case) and interactions amongst these and solve thereafter the underlying equations of motions. This defines the nuclear many-body problem, and mean-field approaches like Hartree-Fock theory and the nuclear shell-model represent different approaches to our solutions of Schroedinger's equation.

===== Back to the stability of matter questions  ===== 
!bblock Do we understand the physics of dripline systems?

We start our tour of experimental data and our interpretations by
considering the chain of oxygen isotopes. In the exercises below you
will be asked to perform similar analyses for other chains of
isotopes.

The oxygen isotopes are the heaviest isotopes for which the drip line
is well established.  The drip line is defined as the point where
adding one more nucleon leads to an unbound nucleus. Below we will see
that we can define the dripline by studying the separation
energy. Where the neutron (proton) separation energy changes sign as a
function of the number of neutrons (protons) defines the neutron
(proton) drip line.

The oxygen isotopes are simple enough to be described by some few
selected single-particle degrees of freedom.

* Two out of four stable even-even isotopes exhibit a doubly magic nature, namely ${}^{22}\mbox{O}$ ($Z=8$, $N=14$) and ${}^{24}\mbox{O}$ ($Z=8$, $N=16$).
* The structure of ${}^{22}\mbox{O}$ and ${}^{24}\mbox{O}$ is assumed to be governed by the evolution of the $1s_{1/2}$ and $0d_{5/2}$  one-quasiparticle states.
* The isotopes ${}^{25}\mbox{O}$, ${}^{26}\mbox{O}$, ${}^{27}\mbox{O}$ and ${}^{28}\mbox{O}$ are outside the drip line, since the $0d_{3/2}$ orbit is not bound.

!bblock 
Our first approach in analyzing data theoretically, is to see if we can use experimental information to 

* Extract information about a *so-called* single-particle  behavior
* And interpret such a behavior in terms of the underlying forces and microscopic physics

The next step is to see if we could use these interpretations to say something about shell closures and magic numbers. Since we focus on single-particle properties, a quantity we can extract from experiment is the separation energy for protons and neutrons. Before we proceed, we need to define quantities like masses and binding energies.   Two excellent reviews on 
recent trends in the determination of nuclear masses can be found in the articles of "Lunney and co-workers":"http://journals.aps.org/rmp/abstract/10.1103/RevModPhys.75.1021" and "Blaum and co-workers":"http://iopscience.iop.org/1402-4896/2013/T152/014017/"

===== Masses and Binding energies ===== 
!bblock
A basic quantity which can be measured for the ground states of nuclei is the atomic mass $M(N, Z)$ of the neutral atom with atomic mass number $A$ and charge $Z$. The number of neutrons is $N$.

Atomic masses are usually tabulated in terms of the mass excess defined by
!bt
\[
\Delta M(N, Z) =  M(N, Z) - uA,
\]
!et
where $u$ is the Atomic Mass Unit 
!bt
\[
u = M(^{12}\mathrm{C})/12 = 931.49386 \hspace{0.1cm} \mathrm{MeV}/c^2.
\]
!et
In this course we will mainly use 
data from the 2003 compilation of "Audi, Wapstra and Thibault":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/03759474/729/1".
!eblock

!split

!bt 
\[
m_p = 938.27203(8)\hspace{0.1cm} \mathrm{MeV}/c^2 = 1.00727646688(13)u,
\]

and
!bt 
\[
m_n = 939.56536(8)\hspace{0.1cm} \mathrm{MeV}/c^2 = 1.0086649156(6)u.
\]
!et

In the 2003 mass evaluation there are 2127 nuclei measured with an accuracy of 0.2
MeV or better, and 101 nuclei measured with an accuracy of greater than 0.2 MeV. For
heavy nuclei one observes several chains of nuclei with a constant $N-Z$ value whose masses are obtained from the energy released in $\alpha$-decay.
!eblock


!split 
===== Masses and Binding energies ===== 
!bblock
The nuclear binding energy is defined as the energy required to break up a given nucleus
into its constituent parts of $N$ neutrons and $Z$ protons. In terms of the atomic masses $M(N, Z)$ the binding energy is defined by
!bt
\[
BE(N, Z) = ZM_H c^2 + Nm_n c^2 - M(N, Z)c^2 ,
\]
!et
where $M_H$ is the mass of the hydrogen atom and $m_n$ is the mass of the neutron.
In terms of the mass excess the binding energy is given by
!bt
\[
BE(N, Z) = Z\Delta_H c^2 + N\Delta_n c^2 -\Delta(N, Z)c^2 ,
\]
!et
where $\Delta_H c^2 = 7.2890$ MeV and $\Delta_n c^2 = 8.0713$ MeV.

===== Liquid drop model as a simple parametrization of binding energies  =====
!bblock 

A popular and physically intuitive model which can be used to parametrize 
the experimental binding energies as function of $A$, is the so-called 
the liquid drop model. The ansatz is based on the following expression
!bt
\[ 
BE(N,Z) = a_1A-a_2A^{2/3}-a_3\frac{Z^2}{A^{1/3}}-a_4\frac{(N-Z)^2}{A},
\]
!et
where $A$ stands for the number of nucleons and the $a_i$s are parameters which are determined by a fit 
to the experimental data.  
!eblock


!split
===== Liquid drop model as a simple parametrization of binding energies  =====
!bblock 
To arrive at the above expression we have assumed that we can make the following assumptions:

 * There is a volume term $a_1A$ proportional with the number of nucleons (the energy is also an extensive quantity). When an assembly of nucleons of the same size is packed together into the smallest volume, each interior nucleon has a certain number of other nucleons in contact with it. This contribution is proportional to the volume.

 * There is a surface energy term $a_2A^{2/3}$. The assumption here is that a nucleon at the surface of a nucleus interacts with fewer other nucleons than one in the interior of the nucleus and hence its binding energy is less. This surface energy term takes that into account and is therefore negative and is proportional to the surface area.

!eblock

!split
===== Liquid drop model as a simple parametrization of binding energies, continues  =====
!bblock 

 * There is a Coulomb energy term $a_3\frac{Z^2}{A^{1/3}}$. The electric repulsion between each pair of protons in a nucleus yields less binding. 

 * There is an asymmetry term $a_4\frac{(N-Z)^2}{A}$. This term is associated with the Pauli exclusion principle and reflectd the fact that the proton-neutron interaction is more attractive on the average than the neutron-neutron and proton-proton interactions.

We could also add a so-called pairing term, which is a correction term that
arises from the tendency of proton pairs and neutron pairs to
occur. An even number of particles is more stable than an odd number. 
Performing a least-square fit to data, we obtain the following numerical values for the various constants
* $a_1=15.49$ MeV
* $a_2=17.23$ MeV
* $a_3=0.697$ MeV
* $a_4=22.6$ MeV

In order to do so, we  consider first energy conservation for nuclear transformations that include, for

!bt
\[
{^{N_a+Z_a}}a+ {^{N_b+Z_b}}b\rightarrow {^{N_c+Z_c}}c

!et
Spontaneous decay involves a single initial nuclear state and is allowed if $Q > 0$. In the decay, energy is released in the form of the kinetic energy of the final products. Reactions involving two initial nuclei are called endothermic (a net loss of energy) if $Q < 0$. The reactions are exothermic (a net release of energy) if $Q > 0$.

===== Features to be noted  =====
!bblock
Since we will focus in the beginning on single-particle degrees of freedom and mean-field approaches before we
start with nuclear forces and many-body approaches like the nuclear shell-model, there are some features to be noted

* In the discussion of the liquid drop model and binding energies, we note that the total binding energy is not that different from the sum of the individual neutron and proton masses. 
One may thus infer that intrinsic properties of nucleons in a nucleus are close to those of free nucleons.
* In the discussion of the neutron separation energies for the oxygen isotopes, we note  a clear staggering effect between odd and even isotopes with the even ones being more bound (larger separation energies). We will later link this to strong pairing correlations in nuclei.

!eblock 


!split
===== Features to be noted, continues  =====
!bblock
* The neutron separation energy becomes negative at ${}^{25}\mbox{O}$, making this nucleus unstable with respect to the emission of one neutron. A nucleus like ${}^{24}\mbox{O}$ is thus the last stable oxygen isotopes which has been observed. Oxygen-26 has been "found":"journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.108.142503"  to be unbound with respect to ${}^{24}\mbox{O}$.
* We note also that there are large shell-gaps for some nuclei, meaning that more energy is needed to remove one nucleon. These gaps are used to define so-called magic numbers. For the oxygen isotopes we see a clear gap for ${}^{16}\mbox{O}$. We will interpret this gap as one of several experimental properties that define so-called magic numbers. In our discussion below we will make a first interpretation using  single-particle states from the harmonic oscillator and the Woods-Saxon potential. 

In the exercises below you will be asked to perform a similar analysis for other chains of isotopes and interpret the results.

===== Radii  =====
!bblock
The root-mean-square (rms) charge radius has been measured for the ground states of many
nuclei. For a spherical charge density, $\rho(\bm{r})$, the mean-square radius is defined by
!bt
\[
\langle r^2\rangle = \frac{ \int  d \bm{r} \rho(\bm{r}) r^2}{ \int  d \bm{r} \rho(\bm{r})},
\]
!et
and the rms radius is the square root of this quantity denoted by
!bt
\[
R =\sqrt{ \langle r^2\rangle}.
\]
!et
!eblock

!split
===== Radii  =====
!bblock
Radii for most stable
nuclei have been deduced from electron scattering form
factors and/or from the x-ray transition energies of muonic atoms. 
The relative radii for a
series of isotopes can be extracted from the isotope shifts of atomic x-ray transitions.
The rms radius for the nuclear point-proton density, $R_p$ is obtained from the rms charge radius by:
!bt
\[
R_p = \sqrt{R^2_{\mathrm{ch}}- R^2_{\mathrm{corr}}},
\]
!et
where
!bt
\[
R^2_{\mathrm{corr}}= R^2_{\mathrm{op}}+(N/Z)R^2_{\mathrm{on}}+R^2_{\mathrm{rel}},
\]
!et
where 
!bt
\[
R_{\mathrm{op}}= 0.875(7) \mathrm{fm}.
\]
!et  
is the rms radius of the proton, $R^2_{\mathrm{on}} = 0.116(2)$ $\mbox{fm}^{2}$ is the
mean-square radius of the neutron and $R^2_{\mathrm{rel}} = 0.033$ $\mbox{fm}^{2}$ is the relativistic Darwin-Foldy correction. There are additional  smaller nucleus-dependent corrections.

===== Definitions ===== 
!bblock
We will now introduce the potential models we have discussex above, namely the harmonic oscillator and the Woods-Saxon potentials.  In order to proceed, we need some definitions.
 
We define an operator as $\hat{O}$ throughout. Unless otherwise specified the total number of nucleons is
always $A$ and $d$ is the dimension of the system.  In nuclear physics
we normally define the total number of particles to be $A=N+Z$, where
$N$ is total number of neutrons and $Z$ the total number of
protons. In case of other baryons such as isobars $\Delta$ or various
hyperons such as $\Lambda$ or $\Sigma$, one needs to add their
definitions.  When we refer to a single neutron we will use the label $n$ and when we refer to a single proton we will use the label $p$. Unless otherwise specified, we will simply call these particles for nucleons.

Our Hamiltonian is invariant under the permutation (interchange) of two particles.
Since we deal with fermions however, the total wave function is antisymmetric.
Let $\hat{P}$ be an operator which interchanges two particles.
Due to the symmetries we have ascribed to our Hamiltonian, this operator commutes with the total Hamiltonian,
!bt
\[
[\hat{H},\hat{P}] = 0,
\]
!et
meaning that $\Psi_{\lambda}(x_1, x_2, \dots , x_A)$ is an eigenfunction of 
$\hat{P}$ as well, that is
!bt
\[
\hat{P}_{ij}\Psi_{\lambda}(x_1, x_2, \dots,x_i,\dots,x_j,\dots,x_A)=

\]
!et
where $\beta$ is the eigenvalue of $\hat{P}$. We have introduced the suffix $ij$ in order to indicate that we permute particles $i$ and $j$.
The Pauli principle tells us that the total wave function for a system of fermions
has to be antisymmetric, resulting in the eigenvalue $\beta = -1$.

		\sum_{i=1}^A t(x_i)
\]

while the operator $\hat{V}$ for the potential energy is given by
!bt
\begin{equation}
	\hat{V} = \sum_{i=1}^A \hat{u}_{\mathrm{ext}}(x_i) + \sum_{ji=1}^A v(x_i,x_j)+\sum_{ijk=1}^Av(x_i,x_j,x_k)+\dots
label{eq:firstv}
\end{equation}
!et
Hereafter we use natural units, viz.~$\hbar=c=e=1$, with $e$ the elementary charge and $c$ the speed of light. This means that momenta and masses

!split
===== Definitions and notations =====
!bblock
The potential energy part includes also an external potential $\hat{u}_{\mathrm{ext}}(x_i)$.

In a non-relativistic approach to atomic  physics, this external potential is given by the attraction an electron feels from the atomic nucleus. The latter being much heavier than the involved electrons, is often used to define a natural center of mass. In nuclear physics there is no such external potential. It is the nuclear force which results in binding in nuclear systems. In a non-relativistic framework, the nuclear force contains two-body, three-body and more complicated degrees of freedom. The potential energy reads then  
!bt
\[
	\hat{V} = \sum_{ij}^A v(x_i,x_j)+\sum_{ijk}^Av(x_i,x_j,x_k)+\dots
\]
!et
!eblock


!split
===== Definitions and notations, more complicated forces =====
!bblock
Three-body and more  complicated forces arise since we are dealing with protons and neutrons as effective degrees of freedom. We will come back to this topic later. Furthermore, in large parts of these lectures we will assume that the potential energy can be approximated by a two-body interaction only. Our Hamiltonian reads then
!bt
\begin{equation}
	\hat{H} = \sum_{i=1}^A \frac{\mathbf{p}_i^2}{2m_i}+\sum_{ij}^A v(x_i,x_j).
label{eq:firstH}
\end{equation}
!et


!eblock

 



!split
===== A modified Hamiltonian  =====
!bblock
It is however, from a computational point of view, convenient to introduce an external potential $\hat{u}_{\mathrm{ext}}(x_i)$ by adding and substracting it to the original Hamiltonian. 
This means that our Hamiltonian can be rewritten as 
!bt
\[
    \hat{H} = \hat{H}_0 + \hat{H}_I 
    = \sum_{i=1}^A \hat{h}_0(x_i) + \sum_{i < j=1}^A \hat{v}(x_{ij})-\sum_{i=1}^A\hat{u}_{\mathrm{ext}}(x_i),
\]
!et
with

!bt 
\[
  \hat{H}_0=\sum_{i=1}^A \hat{h}_0(x_i) =  \sum_{i=1}^A\left(\hat{t}(x_i) + \hat{u}_{\mathrm{ext}}(x_i)\right).
\]
!et

The interaction (or potential energy term) reads now
!bt 
\[
  \hat{H}_I=  \sum_{i < j=1}^A \hat{v}(x_{ij})-\sum_{i=1}^A\hat{u}_{\mathrm{ext}}(x_i).
\]
!et

In nuclear physics the one-body part $u_{\mathrm{ext}}(x_i)$ is often approximated by a harmonic oscillator potential or a
Woods-Saxon potential. However, this is not fully correct, because as we have discussed, nuclei are self-bound systems and there is no external confining potential. As we will see later, *the $\hat{H}_0$ part of the hamiltonian cannot be used to compute the binding energy of a nucleus since it is not based on a model for the nuclear forces*. That is, the binding energy is not the sum of the individual single-particle energies. 
!eblock


!split
===== A modified Hamiltonian  =====
!bblock
Why do we introduce the  Hamiltonian  in the form
!bt
\[
    \hat{H} = \hat{H}_0 + \hat{H}_I? 
\]
!et
There are many reasons for this. Let us look at some of them, using the harmonic oscillator in three dimensions as our starting point. For the harmonic oscillator we know that

!bt 
\[
  \hat{h}_0(x_i)\psi_{\alpha}(x_i)=\varepsilon_{\alpha}\psi_{\alpha}(x_i),  
\]
!et

where the eigenvalues are $\varepsilon_{\alpha}$ and the eigenfunctions are $\psi_{\alpha}(x_i)$. The subscript $\alpha$ represents quantum numbers like the orbital angular momentum $l_{\alpha}$, its projection $m_{l_{\alpha}}$ and the   
principal quantum number $n_{\alpha}=0,1,2,\dots$. 

The eigenvalues are
!bt
\[
\varepsilon_{\alpha} = \hbar\omega \left(2n_{\alpha}+l_{\alpha}+\frac{3}{2}\right).
\]
!et
!eblock


!split
===== A modified Hamiltonian  =====
!bblock
The following mathematical properties of the  harmonic oscillator are handy. 
 * First of all we have a complete basis of orthogonal eigenvectors. These have well-know expressions and can be easily be encoded. 

 * With a complete basis $\psi_{\alpha}(x_i)$, we can construct a new basis $\phi_{\tau}(x_i)$ by expanding in terms of a harmonic oscillator basis, that is  
!bt
\[
\phi_{\tau}(x_i)=\sum_{\alpha} C_{\tau\alpha}\psi_{\alpha}(x_i),
\]
!et
where $C_{\tau\alpha}$ represents the overlap between the two basis sets. 
 * As we will see later, the harmonic oscillator basis allows us to compute in an expedient way matrix elements of the interactions between two nucleons.  Using the above expansion we can in turn represent nuclear forces in terms of new basis, for example the  Woods-Saxon basis  to be discussed later here.
!eblock


!split
===== A modified Hamiltonian  =====
!bblock
The harmonic oscillator (a shifted one by a negative constant) provides also a very good approximation to most bound single-particle states. Furthermore, it serves as a starting point in building up our picture of nuclei, in particular how we define magic numbers and systems with one nucleon added to (or removed from) a closed-shell core nucleus. The figure here shows 
the various harmonic oscillator states, with those obtained with a Woods-Saxon potential as well, including a spin-orbit splitting (to be discussed below).

===== The harmonic oscillator Hamiltonian  =====
!bblock
In nuclear physics the one-body part $u_{\mathrm{ext}}(x_i)$ is often 
approximated by a harmonic oscillator potential. However,  as we also noted with the Woods-Saxon potential there is no 
external confining potential in nuclei. 

What many people do then, is to add and subtract a harmonic oscillator potential,
with 
!bt
\[
\hat{u}_{\mathrm{ext}}(x_i)=\hat{u}_{\mathrm{ho}}(x_i)= \frac{1}{2}m\omega^2 r_i^2,
\]
!et
where $\omega$ is the oscillator frequency. This leads to 
!bt
\[
    \hat{H} = \hat{H_0} + \hat{H_I} 
    = \sum_{i=1}^A \hat{h}_0(x_i) + \sum_{i < j=1}^A \hat{v}(x_{ij})-\sum_{i=1}^A\hat{u}_{\mathrm{ho}}(x_i),
\]

with 
!bt
\[
  H_0=\sum_{i=1}^A \hat{h}_0(x_i) =  \sum_{i=1}^A\left(\hat{t}(x_i) + \hat{u}_{\mathrm{ho}}(x_i)\right).
\]
!et
Many practitioners use this as the standard Hamiltonian when doing nuclear structure calculations. 
This is ok if the number of nucleons is large, but still with this Hamiltonian, we do not obey translational invariance.  How can we cure this?

===== Translationally Invariant Hamiltonian  =====

 the following expressions are helpful.

!bt 
\[

 \frac{1}{A}\left[\bm{P}^2+\sum_{i < j}(\bm{p}_i-\bm{p}_j)^2\right]

 meaning that
!bt 
\[
 \left[\sum_{i=1}^A\frac{\bm{p}_i^2}{2m} -\frac{\bm{P}^2}{2mA}\right]
 =\frac{1}{2mA}\sum_{i < j}(\bm{p}_i-\bm{p}_j)^2.

!bt
 \[

 with $\omega$ the oscillator frequency,
 we can rewrite the latter as

we can then rewrite the Hamiltonian as

!et
with an external and central symmetric potential $u_{\mathrm{ext}}(x_i)$, which is often 
approximated by a harmonic oscillator potential or a Woods-Saxon potential. Being central symmetric leads to a degeneracy 
in energy which is not observed experimentally. We see this from for example our discussion of separation energies and magic numbers. There are, in addition to the assumed magic numbers from a harmonic oscillator basis of $2,8,20,40,70\dots$ magic numbers like $28$, $50$, $82$ and $126$. 

To produce these additional numbers, we need to add a phenomenological spin-orbit force which lifts the degeneracy, that is
!bt
\[
\hat{h}(x_i) =  \hat{t}(x_i) + \hat{u}_{\mathrm{ext}}(x_i) +\xi(\bm{r})\bm{ls}=\hat{h}_0(x_i)+\xi(\bm{r})\bm{ls}.

which lifts the degeneracy we have seen before in the harmonic oscillator or Woods-Saxon potentials. The value $C$ is the radial
integral involving $\xi(\bm{r})$. Depending on the value of $j=l\pm 1/2$, we obtain

We can also add, in case of proton, a Coulomb potential. The
Woods-Saxon potential has been widely used in parametrizations of
effective single-particle potentials. 

_However, as was the case with
the harmonic oscillator, none of these potentials are linked directly
to the nuclear forces_. 

Our next step is to build a mean field based
on the nucleon-nucleon interaction.  This will lead us to our first
and simplest many-body theory, Hartree-Fock theory.

The Woods-Saxon potential does allow for closed-form or analytical solutions of the eigenvalue problem

For the harmonic oscillator in three dimensions we have closed-form expressions for the energies and analytical solutions for the eigenstates,
with the latter given by either Hermite polynomials (cartesian coordinates) or Laguerre polynomials (spherical coordinates).

To solve the above equation is however rather straightforward numerically.

We will illustrate the numerical solution of Schroedinger's equation by solving it for the harmonic oscillator in three dimensions.
It is straightforward to change the harmonic oscillator potential with a Woods-Saxon potential, or any other type of potentials. 

We are interested in the solution of the radial part of Schroedinger's equation for one nucleon. 
The angular momentum part  is given by the so-called Spherical harmonics. 
 
The radial equation reads
!bt
\[
  -\frac{\hbar^2}{2 m} \left ( \frac{1}{r^2} \frac{d}{dr} r^2
  \frac{d}{dr} - \frac{l (l + 1)}{r^2} \right )R(r) 
     + V(r) R(r) = E R(r).

The oscillator frequency is $\omega$ and the energies are
!bt
\[
E_{nl}=  \hbar \omega \left(2n+l+\frac{3}{2}\right),

Since we have made a transformation to spherical coordinates it means that 
$r\in [0,\infty)$.  
The quantum number
$l$ is the orbital momentum of the nucleon.   Then we substitute $R(r) = (1/r) u(r)$ and obtain
!bt
\[
  -\frac{\hbar^2}{2 m} \frac{d^2}{dr^2} u(r) 
       + \left ( V(r) + \frac{l (l + 1)}{r^2}\frac{\hbar^2}{2 m}
                                    \right ) u(r)  = E u(r) .

=====  Numerical solution of the single-particle Schroedinger equation =====

We introduce a dimensionless variable $\rho = (1/\alpha) r$
where $\alpha$ is a constant with dimension length and get
!bt
\[
  -\frac{\hbar^2}{2 m \alpha^2} \frac{d^2}{d\rho^2} u(\rho) 
       + \left ( V(\rho) + \frac{l (l + 1)}{\rho^2}
         \frac{\hbar^2}{2 m\alpha^2} \right ) u(\rho)  = E u(\rho) .
\]
!et
Let us specialize to $l=0$. 
Inserting $V(\rho) = (1/2) k \alpha^2\rho^2$ we end up with
!bt
\[
  -\frac{\hbar^2}{2 m \alpha^2} \frac{d^2}{d\rho^2} u(\rho) 
       + \frac{k}{2} \alpha^2\rho^2u(\rho)  = E u(\rho) .
\]
!et
We multiply thereafter with $2m\alpha^2/\hbar^2$ on both sides and obtain
!bt
\[
  -\frac{d^2}{d\rho^2} u(\rho) 
       + \frac{mk}{\hbar^2} \alpha^4\rho^2u(\rho)  = \frac{2m\alpha^2}{\hbar^2}E u(\rho) .

The constant $\alpha$ can now be fixed
so that
!bt
\[
\frac{mk}{\hbar^2} \alpha^4 = 1,

This is the first equation to solve numerically. In three dimensions

where $h$ is our step.
Next we define minimum and maximum values for the variable $\rho$,

\[

we can rewrite the Schroedinger equation for $\rho_i$ as
!bt
\[
-\frac{u(\rho_i+h) -2u(\rho_i) +u(\rho_i-h)}{h^2}+\rho_i^2u(\rho_i)  = \lambda u(\rho_i),
\]
!et
or in  a more compact way
!bt
\[
-\frac{u_{i+1} -2u_i +u_{i-1}}{h^2}+\rho_i^2u_i=-\frac{u_{i+1} -2u_i +u_{i-1} }{h^2}+V_iu_i  = \lambda u_i.

We let the spacing between the doubly degenerate single-particle states be constant, with value $d$.  The first state
has energy $d$. There are only three available single-particle states, $p=1$, $p=2$ and $p=3$, as illustrated

This simple model catches several birds with a stone. It demonstrates how we can build linear combinations
of Slater determinants and interpret these as different admixtures to a given state. It represents also the way we are going to interpret these contributions.  The two-particle states above $p=1$ will be interpreted as 
excitations from the ground state configuration, $p=1$ here.  The reliability of this ansatz for the ground state, 
with two particles in $p=1$,
depends on the strength of the interaction $g$ and the single-particle spacing $d$.
Finally, this model is a simple schematic ansatz for studies of pairing correlations and thereby superfluidity/superconductivity  
in fermionic systems. 

FIGURE: [figslides/simplemodel.png, width=500 frac=0.6] Schematic plot of the possible single-particle levels with double degeneracy. The filled circles indicate occupied particle states. The spacing between each level $p$ is constant in this picture. We show some possible two-particle states.
