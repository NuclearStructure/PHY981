\section{Introduction}

The HF solver that you have developed is the starting point to study a number 
of different approximations to the many-body problem. In phase III of the 
computational projects, we propose that you try and implement one of the 
following extensions beyond HF.
\begin{itemize}
\item Implement the density matrix expansion of the Minnesota potential. The 
goal here is to benchmark the DME -- which produces a functional of the local 
density -- against the exact result.
\item Solve the HFB equations in spherical symmetry. The level of difficulty 
should not be too high if you understand your HF solver well. In addition to 
doubling the size of the matrix to diagonalize and dealing with the pairing 
tensor, one technical difficulty is to determine the Fermi energy by solving a 
Newton-like method.
\item Solve the RPA equations in spherical symmetry. It is also relatively 
simple, but you will need to pay attention to your implementation, since naive 
brute force could make your code very slow.
\item Solve the deformed HF equations. This is probably the most ambitious
project: you need to set up new quadrature rules and basis functions, and put 
up some significant work into designing your implementation, else your code 
will run for ever...
\end{itemize}
